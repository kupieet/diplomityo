\chapter{Inclusion and exclusion criteria}
\label{app:Criteria}

Inclusion criteria
\begin{itemize}
  \item Papers that present the use and experiences of metrics in an agile
  industry setting.
\end{itemize}

Exclusion criteria
\begin{itemize}
  \item Papers that don't contain empirical data from industry cases.
  \item Papers that are not in English.
  \item Papers that don't have agile context. There is evidence of
  clearly non-agile practices or there is no agile method named. For example,
  paper mentions agile but case company has only three releases per year.
  \item Paper is only about one agile practice, which is not related to
  measuring.
  \item Papers that don't seem to have any data about metric usage. Similarly,
  if there are only a few descriptions of metrics but no other info regarding
  reasons or usage.
  \item Papers that have serious issues with grammar or vocabulary and
  therefore it takes considerable effort to understand sentences.
  %\item Papers that refer to another paper where the actual case is discussed.
  %\item Papers that are in academic or semi-academic setting - customer or
  %part of workers are from industry. The reason for this is that it doesn't
  %fully represent industry setting as software development methods are likely
  %enforced by academia. \juha{tämä sisältyy tai vain tarkentaa ensimmäistä}
  \item Papers where the setting is not clear or results cannot be separated by setting, for example
  surveys where there is data both from academia and industry. %Similar
%  exclusion if results cannot be separated by software development method. 
  %\item Papers where the setting is not clear. For example only mention of
  %context is ``100 junior developers''.\juha{yhdistin edelliseen}

  %%\item Papers that are full conference proceedings. Individual papers should be already listed separately.
  \item Papers where the metrics are only used for the research. For
  example author measures which agile practices correlate with success.
  %%\item Papers that don't even show measurement usage in a pilot setting. For
  %%example method or metric is used against static industrial data set. \juha{tämä sisältyy tai vain tarkentaa ensimmäistä}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Quality assesment questions}
\label{app:quality}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Is this a research paper?
  \item Is there are a clear statement of the aims of the research?
  \item Is there an adequate description of the context in which the research
  was carried out?
  \item Was the research design appropriate to address the aims of the
  research?
  \item Was the recruitment strategy appropriate to the aims of the research?
  \item Was there a control group with which to compare treatments?
  \item Was the data collected in a way that addressed the research issue?
  \item Was the data analysis sufficiently rigorous?
  \item Has the relationship between researcher and participants been
  considered adequately?
  \item Is there a clear statement of findings?
  \item Is the study of value for research or practice?
\end{enumerate}
