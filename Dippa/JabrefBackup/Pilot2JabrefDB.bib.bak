  abstract = {Tailoring of methods is commonplace in the vast majority of software
	development projects and organisations. However, there is not much
	known about the tailoring and engineering of agile methods, or about
	how these methods can be used to complement each other. This study
	investigated tailoring of the agile methods, eXtreme programming
	(XP) and Scrum, at Intel Shannon, and involved experienced software
	engineers who continuously monitored and reflected on these methods
	over a 3-year period. The study shows that agile methods may individually
	be incomplete in supporting the overall development process, but
	XP and Scrum complement each other well, with XP providing support
	for technical aspects and Scrum providing support for project planning
	and tracking. The principles of XP and Scrum were carefully selected
	(only six of the 12 XP key practices were implemented, for example)
	and tailored to suit the needs of the development environment at
	Intel Shannon. Thus, the study refutes the suggestion that agile
	methods are not divisible or individually selectable but achieve
	their benefits through the synergistic combination of individual
	agile practices; rather, this study shows that an a la carte selection
	and tailoring of practices can work very well. In the case of Scrum,
	some local tailoring has led to a very committed usage by developers,
	in contrast to many development methods whose usage is limited despite
	being decreed mandatory by management. The agile practices that were
	applied did lead to significant benefits, including reductions in
	code defect density by a factor of 7. Projects of 6-month and 1-year
	duration have been delivered ahead of schedule, which bodes well
	for future ability to accurately plan development projects. © 2006

	of the impacts of agile practices in a live setting. One means of

	are a number of influencing factors that contribute to the success
	of such a case study. In this paper, we describe a case study performed
	at Sabre Airline Solutions TM evaluating the effects of adopting
	Extreme Programming (XP) practices with a team that had characteristically
	plan-driven risk factors. We compare the team's business-related
	results (productivity and quality) to two published sources of industry
	averages. Our case study found that the Sabre team yielded above-average
	post-release quality and average to above-average productivity. We
	discuss our experience in conducting this case study, including specifics
	of how data was collected, the rationale behind our process of data
	collection, and what obstacles were encountered during the case study.
	We identify four factors that potentially impact the outcome of industrial
	case studies: availability of data, tool support, cooperative personnel
	and project status. Recognizing and planning for these factors is
	essential to conducting industrial case studies. © 2006 Elsevier

	to improve the quality of their products. Testing practices used
	to assess the product play a key role in influencing the quality.
	Recent results show that the popularity of the agile processes like
	XP is growing. Since XP is people-oriented (unlike other software
	development methods that are either process or product-oriented)
	there is a sudden surge in the confidence levels of customers and
	programmers. Our contributions in this paper are: (1) To identify
	the extremes to which methods like XP can go to handle the testing
	phases. Testing starts early in XP projects. Design, implementation
	and testing all happen together under incremental development. (2)
	To systematically analyse how the testing practices help specifically
	to improve the product quality. (3) To identify software product
	quality assessment methods in XP projects and relate product quality
	factors to product quality metrics with respect to XP practices.
	Through our approach we investigate the benefits of XP methodology
	and its capacity to deliver high quality software through its testing
	practices especially in small-scale software companies.},

  abstract = {Telecom Product Maintenance at two Ericsson R&D Centers implemented
	Kanban. The third level maintenance is performed by the Customer
	Support Request (CSR) teams and by the design maintenance teams,
	which are located in two sites. There are separate backlogs for the
	customer support and for the design maintenance in the primary site
	and a third backlog for the design maintenance in the secondary site.
	Pull mindset, team working, team empowerment, and continuous improvement
	have become part of the everyday activities. Best practices from
	Scrum have been selected to complement the Kanban implementation.
	Also, the metrics have been reviewed. The major challenges have been
	related to the boundary rules, for instance, multi-site working,
	the platform dependency and the service level agreements but also
	to the roles and responsibilities. The Kanban boards and the chosen
	practices have been adjusted as the understanding of Lean has increased.
	This industry paper presents the journey to Lean product maintenance
	including the identification of the key success factors that are
	to some extent generalizable. First, the overall implementation is
	discussed followed by a deeper description of the implementation
	both in the CSR handling and in the Fault Handling (design maintenance)
	including also the experiences from the secondary R&D site. The paper
	continues by discussing the identified challenges and positive effects.
	At the end of the paper, the implementation concepts and key success
	factors are stated. © 2011 IEEE.},

	software products faster and with better quality - thus leaving little

	the desired high speed of the projects and the optimal capacity,bottlenecks
	existing in the projects have to be monitored and effectively removed.
	The objective of this research is to show experiences from a mature
	software development organization working according to Lean and Agile
	software development principles. By conducting a formal case study
	at Ericsson we were able to elicit and automate measures required
	to monitor bottlenecks in software development workflow, evaluated
	in one of the projects. The project developed software for one of
	the telecom products and consisted of over 80 developers. The results
	of the case study include a measurement system with a number of measures/indicators
	which can indicate existence of bottlenecks in the flow of work in
	the project and a number of good practices helping other organizations
	to start monitoring bottlenecks in an effective way - in particular
	what to focus on when designing such a measurement system. © 2011

  abstract = {Can Agile approaches be used successfully in large organizations,
	where traditional methods and high levels of governance are the norm?
	Although the iterative, agile approaches have been seen to work well
	in small, flexible organizations, or on smaller projects, they frequently
	fall foul of the larger organization's need for governance, investment
	appraisal and control. Formed in 1967, OCLC develops software for
	use by libraries and their users, museums, and academic institutions.
	Researchers, students, faculty, scholars, professional librarians
	and other information seekers use OCLC services to obtain bibliographic,
	abstract and full-text information. OCLC aims to be the leading global
	library cooperative. More than 54,000 libraries in 96 countries and
	territories around the world use OCLC services to locate, acquire,
	catalog, lend and preserve library materials. This paper examines
	how TCC, a training and consultancy company from Cheshire, England
	has worked with OCLC, the Online Computer Library Center based in
	Dublin, Ohio to incorporate the Dynamic Systems Development Method
	(DSDM) into a development culture that was deeply-rooted in "traditional"
	software development methods. Examples from multiple projects illustrate
	how the adoption of DSDM helped OCLC change its culture and achieve
	success in software development and deployment. OCLC's TLC dashboard
	was used to track the effectiveness of the development cycle, and
	to collect metrics from 2003 to the present. We discuss some of the
	challenges we faced and the six agile steps to success. © 2006 IEEE.},
