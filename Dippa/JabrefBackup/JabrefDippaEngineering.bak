  abstract = {In this paper, we describe BuildBot, a robotic interface developed
	to assist with the continuous integration process utilized by co-located
	agile software development teams. BuildBot's physical nature allows
	us to engage the agile software development team members through
	vision, hearing and touch. In this way, BuildBot becomes an active
	part of the development process by bringing together human-robot
	interaction, human group dynamics and software engineering concepts
	through a number ofinteraction modalities. In this paper we describe
	the design and implementation ofthe BuildBot prototype, a robotic
	interface that can sense virtual stimuli, in this case the state
	of a software build, and react accordingly in a physical way via
	vision, sound and touch. We present an early evaluation comparing
	BuildBot to two other tools used by an agile team to monitor the
	continuous integration process. We also show preliminary results
	indicating that BuildBot may be more noticeable to the developers
	and contribute to a fun and lighthearted atmosphere. We argue that
	by increasing awareness of the state of the software build, BuildBot
	can assist in the self-supervision ofagile software engineering teams
	and can help the team achieve its goals in a more engaging and sociable
	manner. Â©2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an adaptive antenna tilting approach in an overlay
	UMTS FDD network. The purpose is to introduce and investigate an
	antenna element which can be remotely controlled by the radio network,
	in order to adequately cater for the spatial and temporal dynamic
	traffic distributions. The tilting angle is computed by a two level
	control mechanism: the higher level is controlled by the network
	manager and consists of a look-up table with the possible ranges
	(intervals or discrete steps for angles) of the antenna angle adjustments.
	The lower level is controlled by the element manager, e.g. RNC controlling
	and recording the track of the dynamic antenna changes. To enhance
	the system reliability, we associate the less dynamic traffic with
	the primary fixed tilt antenna, whereas the more varying traffic
	is controlled by a second more dynamically tilted antenna element.
	Through system level simulations, we show that significant gains
	in term of system capacity can be obtained. In addition, solutions
	involving the network management subsystem in UMTS FDD are also given,
	where the element management platform interacts with the performance
	measurement units. Intelligent inter-frequency handovers are deliberately
	discussed.},

	Improvement is a highly iterative, adaptive planning method, light

	management and organization of software engineering through use of
	agile metrics such as velocity and cumulative flow but with an added

	vapor compression refrigeration cycle (VCRC) equipment is extremely
	desirable for equipment owners and operators. The specific type of
	VCRC equipment studied in this paper is a 70-ton helical rotary,
	air-cooled chiller. The fault detection and diagnostic (FDD) tool
	developed as part of this research analyzes chiller operating data
	and detects faults through recognizing trends or patterns existing
	within the data [1]. The FDD method incorporates a neural network
	(NN) classifier to infer the current state given a vector of observables.
	Therefore the FDD method relies upon the availability of normal and
	fault empirical data for training purposes and therefore a fault
	library of empirical data is assembled [2]. This paper presents procedures
	for conducting sophisticated fault experiments on chillers that simulate
	air-cooled condenser, refrigerant, and oil related faults. The experimental
	processes described here are not well documented in literature and
	therefore will provide the interested reader with a useful guide.
	In addition, the authors provide evidence, based on both thermodynamics
	and empirical data analysis, that chiller performance is significantly
	degraded during fault operation. The chiller's performance degradation
	is successfully detected and classified by the NN FDD classifier
	as discussed in the paper's final section.},

	There appears to be two basic stand points. The first sees ISI as
	a true risk reducer, which can be used to ensure the safety of a
	component against failure. This view then leads naturally to a Risk
	Based In-Service Inspection (RBISI) philosophy. The second does not
	see the prime importance of ISI as a risk reducer but more as a confidence
	builder, providing some form of `defence in depth' behind an already
	established safety case. This tends to lean to an ISI philosophy
	based more on random sample inspections so as to reveal the `unexpected',
	or what has sometimes been called `Factor X'! This paper does not
	attempt to provide an answer to these two different views. Instead
	it tries to tread a mid-way path between them, looking to see if
	the two can be reconciled. This is done via a series of hypothetical
	examples evaluated using the probabilistic fracture mechanics program
	RR-PRODIGAL and a Bayesian updating process to assess confidence.},

  abstract = {An experimental investigation and a burning-rate analysis have been
	performed on a production 1.4 liter CNG (compressed natural gas)
	engine fueled with methane-hydrogen blends. The engine features a
	pent-roof combustion chamber, four valves per cylinder and a centrally
	located spark plug. The experimental tests have been carried out
	in order to quantify the cycle-to-cycle and the cylinder-to-cylinder
	combustion variation. Therefore, the engine has been equipped with
	four dedicated piezoelectric pressure transducers placed on each
	cylinder and located by the spark plug. At each test point, in-cylinder
	pressure, fuel consumption, induced air mass flow rate, pressure
	and temperature at different locations on the engine intake and exhaust
	systems as well as 'engine-out' pollutant emissions have been measured.
	The signals correlated to the engine operation have been acquired
	by means of a National Instruments PXI-DAQ system and a home developed
	software. The acquired data have then been processed through a combustion
	diagnostic tool resulting from the integration of an original multizone
	thermodynamic model with a CAD procedure for the evaluation of the
	burned-gas front geometry. The diagnostic tool allows the burning
	velocities to be computed. The tests have been performed over a wide
	range of engine speeds, loads and relative air-fuel ratios (up to
	the lean operation). For stoichiometric operation, the addition of
	hydrogen to CNG has produced a bsfc reduction ranging between 2 to
	7% and a bsTHC decrease up to the 40%. These benefits have appeared
	to be even higher for lean mixtures. Moreover, hydrogen has shown
	to significantly enhance the combustion process, thus leading to
	a sensibly lower cycle-to-cycle variability. As a matter of fact,
	hydrogen addition has generally resulted into extended operation
	up to RAFR = 1.8. Still, a discrepancy in the abovementioned conclusions
	was observed depending on the engine cylinder considered. Copyright

	vehicles in a competitive situation. In addition to intelligent behaviour,
	the participating vehicles must also exhibit ruggedness and endurance
	in order to survive the fast ride over rough terrain ("win with the
	software - lose with the hardware"). The SciAutonics teams decided
	to use compact and agile vehicles that employ proven mechanical designs
	very suitable for the desert environment. 4-wheel drive ensures robust
	controllability even in slippery ground, and a roll cage protects
	the vehicle components from damage in case of a collision. The control
	system relies primarily on a differential GPS (Starfire) and a set
	of inertial sensors for navigating between the given set of waypoints.
	A sensor suite using infrared laser (LIDAR) and ultrasound sensing
	provides the capability of obstacle avoidance and path following.
	This paper shows the components of the vehicle and results from driving
	at the DGC.},

  abstract = {The presence of solids flow maldistributions is a common occurrence
	in lean phase pneumatic conveying. As the gas and particles change
	direction in an elbow, the particles stratify into a narrow localized
	stream, forming what is referred to as a particle rope. The presence
	of roping can cause operating and maintenance problems, including
	pipe erosion, difficulties in measuring solids flow rate and difficulties
	in controlling the flow distributions in complex piping networks.
	This paper describes the application of computational fluid dynamics
	(CFD) software to develop and design flow mixing devices for pneumatic
	conveying applications. A combined numerical and experimental study
	was conducted to investigate mixing with devices installed immediately
	downstream of a 90 degree pipe bend. Coal particles with a mean diameter
	of 59 Î¼m were transported with air in a pipeline which has a vertical
	run of 3.4 m and an inside diameter of 0.154 m. Numerical simulations
	were carried out using the CFX-4.2 code developed by AEA Technology.
	Particle motions were modeled using the Lagrangian tracking scheme.
	In order to verify these results, a reflective fiber optic probe
	was employed to measure local particle velocities and concentrations.
	The comparison of predicted and measured particle velocities and
	concentrations showed that CFD simulations gave good agreement with
	the measurements.},

	(below 600Â°C) for a short period (less than 10 min) did not affect

	It is recommended that the temperature is continuously measured with
	thermoelements. The geometry (straightness) after straightening can
	have a significant effect on fatigue life. Gas heating or induction
	heating are recommended. The surface smoothness can be slightly improved
	by glass peening with an intensity of 0.10 Almen A, which also increases
	the fatigue life, sometimes by a factor 10 or more. The particular

  abstract = {A high-resolution Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner prototype,
	named Clear-PEM, was developed by the Portuguese PET Consortium in
	the framework of the Crystal Clear Collaboration (CCC). This scanner
	is a PET prototype dedicated for breast cancer imaging mammography,
	based on a novel readout scheme constituted by fine-pitch scintillator
	crystals, avalanche photodiodes (APD), low-noise high-gain frontend
	amplifiers and a reconfigurable FPGA-based electronics readout system.
	The Clear-PEM scanner is designed to exam both the breast and the
	auxiliary lymph node areas, aiming at the detection of tumours down
	to 2 mm in diameter. The prototype has two planar detector heads,
	each composed of 96 detector modules. Each detector module is composed
	of a matrix of 32 identical 2x2x20 mm3 LYSO:Ce scintillator crystals,
	read at both ends by Hamamatsu S8550 APD arrays (4x8) for Depth-of-Interaction
	(DOI) capability. The APD arrays were characterized through the measurement
	of gain and dark current as a function of bias voltage, under controlled
	conditions. A set of 984 APD arrays followed a well defined quality
	control (QC) protocol, aiming at the rejection of arrays not complying
	with the defined specifications. From the total of 984, only 1 (0.1%)
	was rejected, reassuring the trust in these detectors for prototype
	assembly and future applications.},

	the new generation of factory control software designed to run factories
	without direct human intervention. These systems work especially
	well when running large volumes of fully qualified products on fully
	qualified tools. However, a great deal of planning and creativity
	is required to setup and maintain these systems to make them adaptable
	for new product/process qualification and ramp, new tool qualification,
	tool/process monitoring, sharing of production and development tools,
	and many other activities driven by shortening product life cycles
	and other aspects of the modern semiconductor industry. Responsibility
	for ensuring that the fab can be powerful, agile, and flexible lies
	across many internal organizations. But the responsibility lies most
	directly with the product integration/route build team and the factory
	systems integrators/lead users. The product integration/route build
	teams are responsible for defining all factory entities that will
	be controlled or need to be monitored for fab control. The factory
	systems integrators/lead users must then configure their systems
	run the fab within this environment fully defined by the product
	integration/route build teams. This article will explain how the
	fab "model" cannot be too simple or generic to allow the factory
	systems to properly monitor the fab and take appropriate and timely
	action for efficient production. Conversely the fab "model" cannot
	be so complex that defining product/process changes becomes so labor
	intensive and risk laden that it becomes the major cycle time contributor
	to new product/process introduction. These issues will be explained
	from the perspective of the dispatching system which uses a large
	spectrum of fab data to decide how the fab is run. The solutions
	that these teams use to solve the problems above have a direct effect
	on the ability of the fab to meet the needs of the business.},

  abstract = {An axial-swirl, lean premixed fuel injector typical of stationary
	gas turbine combustors has been analyzed using Large Eddy Simulation
	(LES). The objective of the study was to evaluate the LES modeling
	approach for predicting emissions of CO and NOX at practical engine
	conditions (P=13.6 atm, Tin=734 K = 861Â°F) and over a range of natural
	gas-air equivalence ratios (0.42 to 0.58). Experimental data from
	a recent UTRC/ DOE-NETL program was used to evaluate the model. The
	experimental tests found NOx emissions decreased significantly with
	a decrease in equivalence ratio while CO emissions decreased initially,
	but then increased at the leanest conditions. LES calculations were
	performed using a parallel (domain decomposition), pressure-based,
	unstructured-grid flow solver within the CFD-ACE+ commercial software.
	The LES software solves the general transport equations for mass,
	momentum, energy, and chemical species without assumption at the
	grid-and time-resolved scales of the flow, and models the turbulent
	mixing and chemistry below the locally resolved grid/time-scales.
	The Localized Dynamic subgrid Kinetic energy Model (LDKM) was used
	to model the unresolved turbulence and a 2-step assumed PDF method,
	with decoupled NOX, was used to model the unresolved turbulence-chemistry
	interactions. Parallel calculations on a cluster of 22 Linux-based
	PCs were carried out. It was shown that LES was able to accurately
	predict the CO and NOX at an equivalence ratio of 0.58, and at leaner
	equivalence ratios the model was able to give qualitative agreement
	with the measurements. Some inadequacies in the NOX chemistry at
	ultra lean conditions and the near-wall flow boundaries were observed.},

  abstract = {This paper describes FAST, a novel simulation methodology that can
	produce simulators that (i) are orders of magnitude faster than comparable
	simulators, (ii) are cycle-accurate, (iii) model the entire system
	running unmodified applications and operating systems, (iv) provide
	visibility with minimal simulation performance impact and (v) are
	capable of running current instruction sets such as x86. It achieves
	its capabilities by partitioning simulators into a speculative functional
	model component that simulates the instruction set architecture and
	a timing model component that predicts performance. The speculative
	functional model enables the simulator to be parallelized, implementing
	the timing model in FPGA hardware for speed and the functional model
	using a modified full-system simulators. We currently achieve an
	average simulation speed of 1.2MIPS running x86 applications on x86
	Linux and Windows XP and expect to achieve 10MIPS over time. Such
	simulators are useful to virtually all computer system simulator
	users ranging from architects, through RTL designers and verifiers
	to software developers. Sharing a common simulation/design infrastructure
	could foster better communication between these groups, potentially
	resulting in better system designs. Â© 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of
	a parallel indexer called PAMIS for a polygonal 2D shape image database.
	PAMIS is based on a shape representation scheme called the turning
	function, which exhibits the desirable properties of position-, scale-,
	and rotation-invariance, and has a similarity metric function that
	satisfies the triangular inequality, which is required for efficient
	database indexing. Because the goal of the PAMIS project is to support
	`like-this' image queries, the indexing scheme we chose, the vantage-point
	tree (VPT), uses relative rather than absolute distance values to
	organize the database elements for efficient nearest-neighbor search.
	We have successfully implemented PAMIS on a network of workstations
	to exploit the I/O and computation parallelism inherent in the VPT
	algorithm. We found that it is preferable to make the VPT node size
	as small as possible in order to have a lean and deep VPT structure,
	and the best-case scheduling strategy performs the best among the
	scheduling strategies considered. Overall, the performance of the
	VPT algorithm scales very well with the number of processors, and
	the indexing efficiency, defined as the percentage of database elements
	touched by the search, of PAMIS is 6% and 39% for `good' queries
	that ask for 1 and 50 nearest neighbors, respectively.},

	and the experimental data is generally good once certain adjustments
	were made to the measured data close to the injector tip. The adjustments
	were made based on extrapolation from more accurate downstream measurements.

  abstract = {A variety of life cycle models for software systems development are
	generally available. However, it is generally difficult to compare
	and contrast the methods and very little literature is available
	to guide developers and managers in making choices. Moreover in order
	to make informed decisions developers require access to real data
	that compares the different models and the results associated with
	the adoption of each model. This paper describes an experiment in
	which fifteen software teams developed comparable software products
	using four different development approaches (V-model, incremental,
	evolutionary and Extreme Programming). Extensive measurements were
	taken to assess the time, quality, size, and development efficiency
	of each product. The paper presents the experimental data collected
	and the conclusions related to the choice of method, its impact on
	the project and the quality of the results as well as the general
	implications to the practice of systems engineering project management.

  abstract = {Kerosene-type fuels are the most common aviation fuel, and an understanding
	of their combustion properties is essential for achieving optimized
	gas turbine operation. Presently, however, there is lack of experimental
	flame speed data available by which to validate the chemical kinetic
	mechanisms necessary for effective computational studies. In this
	study, premixed jet fuel surrogate blends and commercial kerosene
	are studied using particle image velocimetry in a stagnation flame
	geometry. Numerical simulations of each experiment are obtained using
	the CHEMKIN-PRO software package and the JetSurF 2.0 mechanism. The
	neat hydrocarbon surrogates investigated include n-decane, methylcyclohexane,
	and toluene, which represent the alkane, cycloalkane, and aromatic
	components of conventional aviation fuel, respectively. Two blends
	are studied in this paper. The first is a binary blend formulated
	to reproduce the laminar flame speed of aviation fuel using a mixing
	rule based on the laminar flame speed and adiabatic flame temperature
	of the hydrocarbon components, weighted by their respective mixture
	mole fractions. The second blend is a tertiary blend formulated to
	emulate the hydrogen to carbon ratio of the kerosene studied. All
	of the considered fuels and blends are studied at three equivalence
	ratios, corresponding to lean, stoichiometric, and rich conditions,
	and at several stretch rates. The centreline axial velocity profiles
	from numerical simulations are directly compared to the measured
	velocity profiles to validate the mechanism at each condition. The
	difference between the experimental and simulated reference flame
	speed is used to infer the true unstretched laminar flame speed of
	the mixture. These results allow the effectiveness of the different
	blending methodologies to be assessed. Copyright Â© 2012 by ASME.},

  abstract = {Background: Left cervical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) using the
	implanted NeuroCybernetic Prosthesis (NCPÂ®) can reduce epileptic
	seizures and has recently been shown to give promising results for
	treating therapy-resistant depression. To address a disadvantage
	of this state-of-the-art VNS device, the use of an alternative transcutaneous
	electrical nerve stimulation technique, designed for muscular stimulation,
	was studied. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been
	used to test non-invasively access nerve structures associated with
	the vagus nerve system. The results and their impact are unsatisfying
	due to missing brainstem activations. These activations, however,
	are mandatory for reasoning, higher subcortical and cortical activations
	of vagus nerve structures. The objective of this study was to test
	a new parameter setting and a novel device for performing specific
	(well-controlled) transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) at the inner side of
	the tragus. This paper shows the feasibility of these and their potential
	for brainstem and cerebral activations as measured by blood oxygenation
	level dependent functional MRI (BOLD fMRI). Materials and methods:
	In total, four healthy male adults were scanned inside a 1.5-Tesla
	MR scanner while undergoing tVNS at the left tragus. We ensured that
	our newly developed tVNS stimulator was adapted to be an MR-safe
	stimulation device. In the experiment, cortical and brainstem representations
	during tVNS were compared to a baseline. Results: A positive BOLD
	response was detected during stimulation in brain areas associated
	with higher order relay nuclei of vagal afferent pathways, respectively
	the left locus coeruleus, the thalamus (left â« right), the left
	prefrontal cortex, the right and the left postcentral gyrus, the
	left posterior cingulated gyrus and the left insula. Deactivations
	were found in the right nucleus accumbens and the right cerebellar
	hemisphere. Conclusion: The method and device are feasible and appropriate
	for accessing cerebral vagus nerve structures, respectively. As functional
	patterns share features with fMRI BOLD, the effects previously studied
	with the NCPÂ® are discussed and new possibilities of tVNS are hypothesised.

  abstract = {The biofuel R-8 (a 50/50 mix of biofuel and Jet A) was tested in a
	low NOX combustor concept developed by United Technologies Aerospace
	Systems for NASA's Environmentally Responsible Aircraft program.
	The multipoint lean direct injection system employed substitutes
	five radially distributed rows of injectors for a single row of larger
	nozzles. The nozzles are grouped into three independently controlled
	fuel stages featuring differing air swirler and fuel injector design.
	The R-8 biofuel remains lit at a slightly lower overall fuel to air
	ratio (FAR) of 0.0054 compared to Jet A which extinguishes at a FAR
	of 0.0055. Emissions measurements for NOX, UHC, and CO are presented
	at different equivalence ratios, pressures, and staging configurations.
	OH* chemiluminescence images help explain the observed emissions
	trends. These images also demonstrate how the reaction zone changes
	drastically depending on the fuel stage configuration. The maximum
	NOx production using the pilot stage alone is measured when the local
	equivalence ratio (calculated from air and fuel flow through the
	pilot stage) is slightly above stoichiometric. In this pilot-only
	mode, there is very little difference in emissions between the R-8
	and Jet A fuels. In the two-stage configuration with constant equivalence
	ratio, increasing the relative amount of fuel sent to the second
	stage decreases the NOX production significantly. For these configurations
	there are large differences between R-8 and Jet A in that the biofuel
	produces more NOX emissions. In a three-stage mode a well distributed
	and low temperature reaction zone with low NOX production is demonstrated.
	The R-8 biofuel again shows more NOX emissions but the size of this
	difference is dependent on the fuel distribution.},

	based on the same requirements specification, by using an original
	approach settled on a vector-based method. The application of this
	method is presented in a practical way, by analyzing 6 software products
	using two different development processes: UPEDU - a scaled-down
	version of the organized process RUP and XP - a member of the agile
	methodologies. An experts' committee measured and analyzed the realization
	quality of each of 109 requirements of equal importance and judged
	them based on an evaluation vector system. Two groups of requirements
	were identified referring dynamic functions and static functions
	of the system. The observational study was conducted in an academic
	environment. An important contribution of this paper is the vector-based
	comparison method that could be generalized and applied in any other
	setting. The findings of this empirical study point to a potential
	link that may exist between the quality of the implemented requirements

	must focus the attention of combustion systems engineers on the need
	to improve the consistency of the combustion process on a cycle to
	cycle basis. Dilution of the air/fuel charge mainly to reduce NO//x
	emissions either by using exhaust gas (exhaust gas recirculation
	method) or with excess air (lean-burn method) exacerbates the problem
	of intercyclic variation especially at road-load engine operating
	conditions. A new hardware/software package (EPICAS) has been developed
	as an analytical tool to meet the needs of combustion systems engineers
	in evaluating the effects on combustion of their own design improvements.
	This study has revealed the existence of combustion system performance
	differentials of a high order including: half to almost four fifths
	in the level of intercyclic variation as measured by 10 key combustion
	parameters.},

	of equivalence ratio and hydrogen concentration at flame flashback
	have been made at pressures ranging from 1 to 8 atmospheres, hydrogen
	concentration in the fuel of 60 to 100% and inlet velocities of 10,
	20, 40 and 80 m/s. Increasing the hydrogen concentration in the fuel
	was found to significantly lower the equivalence ratio at flashback.
	This was believed to be the result of the much higher flame speed
	for hydrogen compared to methane. Increasing pressure was found to
	also decrease the equivalence ratio at flashback, while increasing
	the inlet velocity was found to increase the equivalence ratio at
	flashback. Two of these experiments were reproduced numerically using
	the FLUENTâ¢ software. Numerical data were found to be in good agreement
	with experimental data at atmospheric pressure. The flashback process

	In this paper we describe a new data analysis system that provides
	a scalable, flexible system for composing ad-hoc analyses of high-speed,
	streaming data. This agility allows researchers, network security
	analysts, or network operators to easily compose new analysis functions.
	A growing tool box of filtering, measurement, and statistical tools
	allows new approaches to be tested with a minimum of software development.
	Further, a dynamic type system allows polymorphic analysis modules
	to operate on arbitrary forms of structured data, thus allowing easy
	integration of multiple data sources such as packet traces, netflow
	records, or security logs. In this paper we present this system and
	demonstrate its capabilities while performing several measurements,
	such as computing probability density functions, detecting port-scans,
	and probabilistic counting of traffic traces.},

	Lean production. The game was initially influenced by the Buckingham
	Lean Game and then adjusted to fit an infrastructure production process.
	Focus in the design process and when playing the game is on breaking

	addresses basic Lean principles and tools such as; process design,
	eliminating waste concerning for example materials and space, push

	paper is written the Lean game InFrame has been played half a dozen
	times and so far no quantitative results can be presented. However,
	three levels of reflection can be distinguished. Facing learning
	barriers when meeting practitioners in the construction industry
	is a critical issue for learning. However, games as a first introduction
	to Lean for practitioners is a rather undiscovered field of research
	and need more attention in the future. Further development and research

	a Holonic System by generating holons from the given data. That is,
	it duplicates template holonic software, name it, and stored respective
	data. Each holon has respective instruction decomposition ability
	and instruction allocation function to other holons through negotiation.
	Secondly, Holonic Controller carries out given instructions by decomposing
	instructions in each holon and allocating decomposed instructions
	through negotiations to executable holons. Holonic Controller can
	animate and monitor its processes on computer displays and the constructed
	Holonic System can be checked. Assembly planning of induction motors
	is first testbed for Holonic Controller. About 50 holons cooperating
	each other can generate assembly plans, and the usefulness of Holonic

  abstract = {This paper describes the impact of an agile process support environment
	in helping faculty manage software engineering capstone projects
	and the learning outcomes associated with the capstone experience.
	Software engineering capstone projects are notoriously time-consuming
	to manage for faculty mentors. Team projects often fall behind due
	to the inexperience of the students and the external pressures they
	face. They may be accustomed to performing heroic acts on prior individual
	class projects, and think they can be successful this way again.
	But in a significantly sized real-world team project, they find out
	too late that this approach will not work. Students remain successful
	often by significant effort on the part of a faculty mentor. The
	mentor may setup a process infrastructure to enables project monitoring.
	Mentors may find themselves asking for frequent in-class project
	reviews, out-of-class appointments, and significant documentation.
	Mentoring a capstone project, while a potentially rewarding experience,
	can become a significant time sink and lead to faculty burnout. We
	are utilizing the IBM Jazz environment including the Rational Team
	Concert (RTC) integrated development environment (IDE) to address
	project management for capstone projects using the Agile/Scrum methodology.
	Jazz/RTC allows all stakeholders (students, sponsors, and faculty)
	to transparently review a process to assess project health at any
	point in time. Further, transparent continuous project monitoring
	gives mentors the ability to provide just-in-time-but-not-too-late
	formative feedback, as well as allow continuous assessment of learning
	outcomes. The ability to "see where you are" in the process, and
	understand how the process' practices drive progress and completion,
	is an invaluable learning aid for students struggling to grasp the
	benefits of these methods. Â© American Society for Engineering Education,

	on a discrete set of instant frequencies. The frequency reconfigurability
	is obtained by resorting to electrically actuated switches operated

  abstract = {Accurate modeling of engine knock onset is needed for control of SI
	engine combustion and increase of thermal efficiency. This contribution
	presents a refined model for analysis of engine knock when using
	natural gas fuel and EGR. The model is used to compare the effectiveness
	of EGR to other knock suppression methods such as lean-burn combustion,
	compression ratio reduction, and ignition timing retardation. The
	model consists of two zones: a burned combustion products region
	and an unburned reactants comprising the end gas region, separated
	by a flame front of negligible thickness. A mass burning rate is
	derived from a turbulent combustion model. FORTRAN code as programming
	software is used for combustion simulation. Operating conditions
	which affect an engine's tendency to knock are discussed. The model
	was validated by comparison to experimental data. Results show that
	EGR addition is more effective at suppressing knock, while maintaining
	high thermal efficiency and output work, compared to other knock
	suppression techniques such as inlet pressure and temperature, equivalence
	ratio, spark timing, or compression ratio. Copyright Â© 2008 by ASME.},

	has failed, determining when a control loop is not properly tuned,
	or determining when a valve, damper or actuator is broken, stuck,
	or leaking. The uses of FDD algorithms within standalone software
	programs include assisting with commissioning of HVAC systems and
	chiller plant optimization. The use of FDD in rooftop units is estimated
	to help reduce energy consumption by 10% or more. The use of open
	protocols, factory integrated controls, and new software applications
	help incorporating fault detection algorithms as an integrated part
	of BAS.},

  abstract = {The ever-increasing demand for security in portable energy-constrained
	environments that lack a coherent security architecture has resulted
	in the need to provide energy-efficient algorithm-agile cryptographic
	hardware. Domain-specific reconfigurability is utilized to provide
	the required flexibility, without incurring the high overhead costs
	associated with generic reprogrammable logic. The resulting implementation
	is capable of performing an entire suite of cryptographic primitives
	over the integers modulo N, binary Galois Fields and nonsupersingular
	elliptic curves over GF(2 n), with fully programmable moduli, field
	polynomials and curve parameters ranging in size from 8 to 1024 bits.
	The resulting processor consumes a maximum of 75 mW when operating
	at a clock rate of 50 MHz and a 2-V supply voltage. In ultralow-power
	mode (3 MHz at 0.7 V) the processor consumes at most 525 Î¼W. Measured
	performance and energy efficiency indicate a comparable level of
	performance to previously reported dedicated hardware implementations,
	while providing all of the flexibility of a software-based implementation.
	In addition, the processor is two to three orders of magnitude more
	energy efficient than optimized software and reprogrammable logic-based
	implementations.},

  abstract = {Through inward perceptions, we intuitively expect distributed software
	development to increase the risks associated with achieving cost,
	schedule, and quality goals. To compound this problem, agile software
	development (ASD) insists one of the main ingredients of its success
	is cohesive communication attributed to collocation of the development
	team. The following study identified the degree of communication
	richness needed to achieve comparable software quality (reduce pre-release
	defects) between distributed and collocated teams. This paper explores
	the relevancy of communication richness in various development phases
	and its impact on quality. Through examination of a large distributed
	agile development project, this investigation seeks to understand
	the levels of communication required within each ASD phase to produce
	comparable quality results achieved by collocated teams. Obviously,
	a multitude of factors affects the outcome of software projects.
	However, within distributed agile software development teams, the
	mode of communication is one of the critical components required
	to achieve team cohesiveness and effectiveness. As such, this study
	constructs a distributed agile communication model (DAC-M) for potential
	application to similar distributed agile development efforts using
	the measurement of the suitable level of communication. The results
	of the study show that less rich communication methods, in the appropriate
	phase, might be satisfactory to achieve equivalent quality in distributed
	ASD efforts.},

	1-4 week Sprints and all the trappings of the classic Scrum process,
	including, in some cases, Scrum-of-Scrums. New challenges arise:
	Shared resource constraints suggest Kanban methods. Net Present Value

  abstract = {We propose a novel dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) scheme that is specifically
	directed towards 3D graphics-intensive interactive game applications
	running on battery-operated portable devices. The key to this DVS
	scheme lies in parsing each game frame to estimate its rendering
	workload and then using such an estimate to scale the voltage/frequency
	of the underlying processor. The main novelty of this scheme stems
	from the fact that game frames offer a rich variety of "structural"
	information (e.g. number of brush and alias models, texture information
	and light maps) which can be exploited to estimate their processing
	workload. Although DVS has been extensively applied to video decoding
	applications, compressed video frames do not offer any information
	(beyond the frame types - I, B or P) that can be used in a similar
	manner to estimate their processing workload. As a result, DVS algorithms
	designed for video decoding mostly rely on control-theoretic feedback
	mechanisms, where the workload of a frame is predicted from the workloads
	of the previously-rendered frames. We show that compared to such
	history-based predictors, our proposed scheme performs significantly
	better for game applications. Our experimental results, based on
	the Quake II game engine running on Windows XP, show that for the
	same energy consumption our scheme results in more than 50% improvement
	in quality (measured in terms of number of frames meeting their deadlines)
	compared to history-based prediction schemes. Â© 2008 IEEE.},

	Their combination, given several scenarios, presents opportunities
	for improvement as well as challenges in implementation. However,
	the exploration of eventual interactions and relationships between
	BIM as a process and Lean Construction principles is recent in research.
	The objective of this paper is to identify BIM and Lean relationship
	aspects with a focus on the construction phase and from the perspective
	of the general contractor (GC). This paper is based on a case study
	where BIM is already heavily used by the GC and where the integration
	of Lean practices is recent. We explore areas of improvement and
	Lean contributions to BIM from two perspectives. First, from Sacks
	et al.'s (2010) Interaction Matrix perspective, we identify some
	existing interactions. Second, based on the Capability Maturity Model
	(CMM) of the National Building Information Modeling Standard (NBIMS),
	we measure the level of the project's BIM maturity and highlight
	areas of improvement for Lean. The main contribution of the paper
	is concerned with the exploration of the BIM maturity levels that
	are enhanced by Lean implementation.},

	are all attached to the nozzle body on the end effector. An abrasive
	flow rate sensor was developed and integrated with an automated abrasive
	feed valve for closed-loop control of abrasive flow rate. An orifice
	health sensor was developed to monitor the quality of the waterjet.
	Parameter selection software was also developed to select the optimal
	nozzle cartridge and other operating parameters. Multiple and automatic

  abstract = {A wireless revolution is quietly taking place in global communications
	bought about by a new synergy of wireless technologies. The initial
	drivers of this synergy are primarily the low power, low cost, low
	interference wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) networks, although other wireless
	technologies, such as, WiMAX, wVoIP, Ultra Wideband, Bluetooth and
	RFID will be covered in this paper. The Wi-Fi devices (hotspots)
	can be manufactured today on a single chip in the ten-dollar range,
	and with only increased production, the cost can soon drop to less
	than one dollar. These low cost devices will be integrated - using
	a number of advanced wireless technologies, including smart antennas,
	agile radios and mesh networks all sharing breakthroughs in digital
	signal processing - into computer controlled, wireless, smart networks.
	These intelligent networks will be connected to millions and soon
	billions of new radio-frequency identification device (RFID) sensors.
	These sensors, like Wi-Fi, are built on a low cost, single chip many
	no larger than a grain of sand. The sensor data will be wirelessly
	networked to computer processing and advanced storage devices. This
	synergy, from the sensor chip via smart networks to the storage device,
	will deliver "wireless-Internet-on-a-chip" applications. These applications
	will have the capability to change the way we create things, move
	commerce and understand our world by monitoring and measuring it
	in multi-dimensions with minimal human interaction. The large numbers
	of RFID sensors can track quantities and qualities of materials and
	objects - their heat, movement and even look for probabilistic changes
	in the qualities. One of the big drivers of these active RFID/GPS
	sensors is search and location. Three major customer groups will
	spend large amounts for the ability to know where people are-all
	the time. The first group is the government who want to know where
	potential security threats are. This will include state and local
	governments who want to monitor individuals on probation and keep
	tract of certain types of offenders. The second customer group is
	businesses that want to monitor the whereabouts of their decision
	makers. Business owners are also tired of not knowing where their
	salesmen are on a Friday afternoon. The third customer group is parents
	- primarily mothers, who want to know where their children are -
	all the time. These three customer groups will propel the synergy
	of location seasors, smart, agile wireless hardware and software
	and low-cost networks. These sensor driven networks can vary from
	large, sophisticated, computer controlled systems to small data gathering
	networks, operating in the developing world. Especially in the developing
	world, these sensors will largely operate in wireless local area
	networks (WLANs) connected to simple, satellite ground terminals.
	These sensor networks will have little or no latency requirements
	and thus will be especially satellite friendly. This new revolution
	of chip-driven, wireless, low cost sensors, networks and applications
	will provide important new markets for communications satellites.},

	software process improvement initiatives, and software metrics programs
	are some of the hallmarks of this school of thought. The more recent
	trend towards agile development places the emphasis on constantly
	adapting to a project's changing goals rather than on detailed upfront
	planning. The majority of reports from pracitioners of agile development
	are positive and confirm the advantages of this approach. However,
	moving from a plan driven culture to agile development is not easy.
	Making the transition requires changes to many established practices
	and may even touch core values held by stakeholders. Areas affected
	are requirements and change management, user involvement, willingness
	to take on responsibility, contract management, and the ability to
	live with many uncertainties. This talk looks at what it takes to
	make the transition and presents lessons learned from organizations
	and projects which have successfully completed the switch to agile
	development.},

	regional GNSS test bed demonstration project, the goal is to facilitate
	the implementation and operation of a satellite based aviation navigation
	system. The reference stations are placed in seven economies including
	Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia
	and Taiwan. Among them, Australia uses one reference station from
	its current GRAS network and the reference station in Taiwan is developed
	by National Cheng Kung University. This APEC regional GNSS test bed
	is operational in September 2006. For the further extension of this
	network in Taiwan, we develop a GNSS augmentation system evaluation
	module which includes several reference station modules and one master
	station all with low-cost and flexible architecture, and we could
	quickly implement this GNSS augmentation system evaluation module
	in a region with interested. This paper presents the architecture
	of this GNSS augmentation system evaluation module. This evaluation
	module includes several GNSS reference station modules and one master
	station module. The reference station software could process the
	GNSS observation data from the GNSS receiver into a designate message
	formats, and then transmit these messages to the master station module
	via Internet. Because the communication link is Internet, the master
	station software needs to synchronize incoming messages from the
	time delay caused by Internet, then the master station decode all
	of the messages for monitoring, differential corrections processing
	and observation data logging. All these processes need to be done
	in real-time. The main hardware components in a reference station
	module include a dual frequency GNSS receiver, a portable computation
	processor, and the communication ports. For the reference station
	module we use a module computer with Microsoft Windows XP operating
	system as the platform, and this system can be reproduced quickly
	and easily with a flexible architecture. For the master station we
	use a similar architecture with a higher performance CPU and a larger
	data storage drive. After the development of this GNSS augmentation
	system evaluation module is completed, we will place this module
	at some airports in Taiwan to evaluate the enhancement of the GNSS
	services provided by this module. We will compare this GNSS regional
	evaluation module with the APEC GNSS test bed, and we will also show
	the GNSS performance comparison between this module and the MSAS
	in Taiwan.},

	A two-step procedure is proposed: (1) A search procedure, which acquires
	and processes the designer's search intent to retrieve similar parts.
	(2) A sorting procedure, which ranks these parts in order of their
	similarity to the candidate part. Both procedures are based on GT
	codes, while the second can employ more detailed critical design
	information. This information is assumed available in the product
	databases of distributed partners, and can be generated via an existing
	GT design processor. The approach employs a systematic procedure
	to combine independent similarity indexes to a unique measure for

	heated flow-bench system was utilized in combination with a diesel
	lean NOx trap (LNT) and/or a diesel particulate filter (DPF). The
	heated flow bench had the capability of producing stable gas temperatures
	and pressure drop across these aftertreatment devices. Preliminary
	pressure drop diagnostics were conducted with unloaded substrates
	meant for LNT and DPF applications. Subsequently, the DPF was loaded
	with varying amounts of liquid water or liquid diesel fuel and pressure
	drop diagnostic tests were repeated to determine if the presence
	of liquid substances within the substrate could be detected. With
	the presence of a liquid substance, the DPF exhibited relatively
	flat and undetectable pressure drop variation up to a critical loading
	level. Once this level was reached, there was a sharp and sudden
	increase in pressure drop. Further tests investigated the effects
	of exhaust flow rate and supplemental fuel amount on raising the
	LNT substrate temperature as required for the LNT de-NOx regeneration
	process. The results suggested that the maximum substrate temperature
	was primarily dependant on the fuel amount. Although the exhaust
	flow rate had very little effect on the substrate's maximum temperature,
	it was significant in determining how quickly the maximum temperature
	was reached. Copyright Â© 2010 by ASME.},

	newly built to systemize the state analysis of a shipboard crane.
	The integrated simulator of shipboard crane was realized by cooperating
	a component of external force interface routine and fluid analysis
	software. A transfer control system is conducted by HSA (Hybrid Shape
	Approach) using STT (Straight Transfer Transformation) method and
	its effectiveness in suppressing the sway of both ship and load was
	confirmed by the simulation analysis. A shipboard crane operational
	training system which we call virtual coach teaching system, is also
	presented, in order to shorten the training period of amateur operators.
	The controlled inputs generated from HSA controller which are utilized
	as the ideal commands are then converted to drive a newly built teaching
	interface. Subjects are physically coached through the ideal motion
	of joystick by placing their hand on the teaching interface, thus
	giving them a kinesthetic understanding on how to transfer a load
	without exciting the sway of both the ship and load. Performance

	challenge and a technological opportunity for spectrum sharing. For
	OSAM, we have proposed a method to transform the technical parameters

	Operational Spectrum Effectiveness (OSE). This paper describes our
	investigations into appropriate algorithms for optimizing the derived
	OSE metrics. By adapting equilibrium concepts from microeconomic
	theory, we demonstrate that, with the spectrum management authority
	acting as "market arbiter", OSE optimization for individual entities
	can lead to efficient group-level spectrum utilization solutions.
	We further contend that the solutions thus obtained will be of at
	least equal quality to those derived by traditional methods, with
	the added advantage of near real-time adaptability.},

	This chapter suggests a Risk-Driven Development model (RDD), a model
	integrating risk management with agile development process models.
	It first identifies commonalities in these two process models. It
	then investigates the state of practice of integrating risk management
	with software development in 37 software organizations. The results
	of these two steps provide feedback for outlining the RDD model.

  abstract = {Research on knowledge management (KM) readiness has matured. However,
	recent organizational structures have emerged which prevent traditional
	instruments from adequately measuring KM readiness in an organization.
	For example, service-oriented enterprise (SOE) structure and agile
	software development techniques are characterized by multiple groups
	working together with each performing "services" as part of project
	pattern or process. Each group acts in its own role as a sub-organization
	with its unique helping patterns and cultures [17]. Traditional instruments
	which measure aggregate constructs across the entire organization
	will miss important between-group differences in an SOE that might
	influence KM readiness. This paper presents a case-based field-study
	from a large Fortune 500 financial firm transitioning its structure
	to SOE and considering agile software development methodologies.
	Survey data was collected along with a series of interviews with
	key managers and developers. Findings indicate statistically significant
	differences in KM readiness between groups and the need for alignment.

  abstract = {Attackers and defenders of computer systems both strive to gain complete
	control over the system. To maximize their control, both attackers
	and defenders have migrated to low-level, operating system code.
	In this paper, we assume the perspective of the attacker, who is
	trying to run malicious software and avoid detection. By assuming
	this perspective, we hope to help defenders understand and defend
	against the threat posed by a new class of rootkits. We evaluate
	a new type of malicious software that gains qualitatively more control
	over a system. This new type of malware, which we call a virtual-machine
	based rootkit (VMBR), installs a virtual-machine monitor underneath
	an existing operating system and hoists the original operating system
	into a virtual machine. Virtual-machine based rootkits are hard to
	detect and remove because their state cannot be accessed by software
	running in the target system. Further, VMBRs support general-purpose
	malicious services by allowing such services to run in a separate
	operating system that is protected from the target system. We evaluate
	this new threat by implementing two proof-of-concept VMBRs. We use
	our proof-of-concept VMBRs to subvert Windows XP and Linux target
	systems, and we implement four example malicious services using the
	VMBR platform. Last, we use what we learn from our proof-of-concept
	VMBRs to explore ways to defend against this new threat. We discuss
	possible ways to detect and prevent VMBRs, and we implement a defense
	strategy suitable for protecting systems against this threat. Â©

	It implements the method of charge pumping as well as providing static
	I-V characteristics. The former capability enables one to investigate
	the quality of semiconductor-insulator interfaces and to determine
	mean surface-state density. Employing a USB-compatible microcontroller,
	the instrument has a reasonable size (100 Ã 80 Ã 50 mm3), mass
	(300 g), and power consumption (at most 2.5 W). The instrument is

	designed software under MicrosoftÂ® Windows 2000/XPÂ®. It can measure
	currents from 1 pA to 10 mA with the gate or drain voltage varied

  abstract = {Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a relatively new process developed
	in the early 90's by The Welding Institute (TWI) of the United Kingdom.
	A rotating tool with a specific geometry is used to heat the materials
	to be joined. The heat softened material of the abutting materials
	is entrained and transfered around the tool, where it is deposited
	prior to recoalescence, thereafter forming a joint. The FSW process
	requires advanced automation to ensure consistent and reliable joints.
	This has been realized by the development of an experimental set-up
	by the integration and on-line monitoring of accurate sensors with
	reliable modular control software. With increasing productivity and
	quality requirements imposed by manufacturers, machine flexibility
	and scalability are becoming increasingly pertinent. On-line process
	monitoring facilitates the 'adaption' of machines able to respond
	to changing process parameters and conditions. Modular open software
	architectures allow flexibility in machine application. This paper
	introduces a fresh approach for the integration of the latest automation
	technology into an experimental setup equipped with an advanced sensory
	system. A new method of capturing sensory data and the implementation
	aspects of the software architecture for a micro-kernel based real-time
	embedded operating system is introduced. Agile automation of the
	FSW process is thus realized by advanced monitoring and control.},

  abstract = {DDoS flooding attacks are quite popular with hackers and they can
	cause devastating impact on computer systems. Smurf attack is a type
	of flooding attack that involves ICMP protocol, which is known to
	have brought down high profile commercial websites. A computer system
	running Microsoft's Windows-XP with Service Pack2 (SP2) security
	software is designed to drop ICMP packets by default, which makes
	one believe that ICMP-based flooding attacks cannot harm a computer
	system that deploys SP2 security software. In this experimental paper,
	we set out to test and measure the effectiveness of the Microsoft
	Windows-XP with SP2 security software in protecting a computer system
	from ICMP-based flooding attacks in fast Ethernet environment. We
	simulate Smurf attacks on a computer system in the controlled lab
	environment. In these experiments, we measure the exhaustion of computing
	resource of a computer system with and without Windows-XP SP2 security
	software. It is observed that under Smurf attack, the victim computer
	deploying SP2 security software dropped all ICMP messages; nevertheless,
	the exhaustion of the processor resource of the computer running
	the SP2 security-software couldn't be stopped. Furthermore, it was
	found interestingly that the exhaustion of the processor resource
	of the computer system running the SP2 security was much higher than
	that of the computer system that didn't deploy SP2 security software.
	These experiments show that dropping of ICMP messages by SP2-security
	software at the victim computer is too late of an act in preventing
	the adverse effect of the Smurf attack. Once the attack traffic reaches
	the victim computer, SP2 security software is ineffective in preventing
	the resource exhaustion caused by the attack, even if it is configured
	to drop the ICMP messages. Â© 2006 IEEE.},

	to use agility in the software development process. A recently published
	scheme by one of the authors to use the fuzzy inference system for
	agility metrics, using the parameter Project Velocity as a measure
	of agility, had encouraging results. Project velocity is dependent
	on various parameters that are fuzzy variables. The domain and dependence
	of these fuzzy variables can be represented through membership functions
	and rules. The simulations carried out using Fuzzy Logic Tool Box
	of MATLAB showed that project velocity and its dependent variables
	give a good measure of agility. This paper describes the architecture
	and implementation aspects of software, so as to estimate the agility
	of a software process using fuzzy techniques. The fuzzy if-then rules
	and coefficient are represented in the form of matrix, and the implementation
	of mis software is explained using the state machine model. Â© 2007

	to develop correlations of atomizer performances with engine (or
	rig) test data. Applications of this facility for a dual-orifice
	atomizer with an air shroud, a piloted airblast atomizer, and an
	assembly of a Lean-Direct Injection (LDI) atomizer with premixed
	swirlers are presented. The results indicate that, to have good correlations
	of atomizer performance with engine (or rig) test data, atomizers
	must be tested under high-pressure conditions and characterized three-dimensionally.
	Capabilities are shown to provide critical information for design
	and development of combustion systems.},

  abstract = {Global and lean supply chains subject manufacturers to sudden disruptions
	of different severity that affect shops floors and performance. Due
	to a variety of factors, disruptions do not only occur internally
	but also externally. Hence, if manufacturers want to ensure competitive
	performance in a highly dynamic environment, they have to be capable
	of quickly detecting disruptions and adapting their production adequately.
	The frequent appearance of supply and production glitches, however,
	highlights the inflexibility of existing supply and production systems.
	For detecting disturbances and initiating compensation mechanisms,
	knowledge e.g. about the production system, the good to be produced
	and the supply chain play a crucial role. Knowledge-based technologies
	which rely on a formal model encapsulating knowledge about a domain
	of discourse, can be an enabler for increasing reactivity and robustness
	of future factory automation systems. In this contribution, applications
	and developments of knowledge-based technology in the domain of future
	factory automation are presented. In order to detect supply chain
	disturbances earlier and realize robust, predictive diagnostics,
	the utilization of logic-based models are investigated. To reason
	about compensation options in case of disturbances, an knowledge-based
	production order optimization realized in a Manufacturing Execution
	System (MES) is presented. These knowledge-based operation techniques
	utilize a huge amount of knowledge which have to be available. To
	bridge the gap between engineering and operation, an integrated,
	knowledge-based approach to develop flexible field-level automation
	software, gather required information from Plant Lifecycle Management
	Systems and transfer this engineering knowledge into operation will
	be presented. Â© 2012 IFAC.},

	As a result many product ideas are being valuated through a trial

	an important enabler for these product definitions. This is even
	more true as the off-road industry begins to adopt the open interoperability
	standard ISOBUS (ISO 11783). A comparison between the world wide
	trend for software processes, the Capability Maturity Model (CMM)
	and what type of process would fit the off-road industry is based
	around the maturity of the new product ideas. The strong supply chain
	link between dealers and customers for off-road machines coupled
	with the emerging awareness of electronic functions and controls
	sets a basis for a specialized software development process. An important
	enabler for this 'agile' process is the re-use of code and incremental
	testing with reviews.},

	technique is a sequence of matrix with one spectroscopic and two
	spatial dimensions. This technique allows for the determination of
	chemical composition as well as the spatial information of the specimen
	and therefore it is an efficient tool to assess internal characteristics
	of various biological tissues. This paper introduces the process
	of acquiring chemical shift images of selected biological tissues
	and the determinations of imaging parameters for spectral images
	of optimum quality. An image analysis software was developed and
	image analysis algorithms such as image segmentation, pseudo-color
	processing, and image fusion were established for the analysis of
	spectral images. The software allows for displaying the acquired
	data either as a set spectrum representing the chemical composition
	of each pixel, or image slices representing the spatial distribution
	of an individual component. The efficacy of chemical shift imaging
	is demonstrated in this research with quantitative analysis of lean
	and fat portions of animal tissues.},

	approach can track the nonconformance with multiple causes as well
	as limited knowledge and provide timely diagnostic recovery. A prototype
	of the GINTR system is developed using the Microsoft .NET technology,
	which is considered as the next generation distributed computing
	paradigm. The prototype system developed is generic, fault tolerant,
	and agile. It can be adapted to diverse complex manufacturing environments

	system (CFIS) has recently been developed. Initial testing of the
	CFIS flame holder was performed under conditions similar to those
	present in a modern gas turbine engine thrust augmentor in order
	to determine the stability limits of the flame holder design. Six
	different fuel injection configurations were tested in an effort
	to identify the key factors contributing to stable operation. Flame
	stabilization was achieved only at lean operating conditions for
	five of the fuel injection configurations, while the use of extension
	tubes at the carburetor channel exits in the sixth configuration
	expanded the stability limits to include richer operating conditions.
	Two of the fuel injection configurations were modeled extensively
	using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. In addition, a
	Phase Doppler Particle Analysis (PDPA) was performed during the testing
	of one flame holder configuration to measure fuel droplet size emanating
	from the CFIS exits and into the wake. Stability was found to be
	highly dependent on fuel spray penetration into the main air stream
	and fuel distribution in the wake. Future efforts will focus on optimizing
	fuel placement to further improve stability limits. Copyright Â©

  abstract = {Manual visual inspection is by far the most widely used weld inspection
	method. A given weld may be visually examined multiple times as parts
	are joined and made into assemblies. Because visual inspection is
	somewhat subjective, and prone to error (a typical inspector only
	identifies about 85% of the visible defects); welds that pass one
	inspection may fail subsequent inspections, resulting in multiple
	inspection and repair cycles. This paper discusses a project that
	tested the benefits and limitations of a semiautomated weld inspection
	system. The goal of this semiautomated inspection approach is to
	provide quantitative, nonsubjective quality measurements of welded
	structures in order to: eliminate redundant inspections, reduce unnecessary
	multiple repair cycles, avoid repair of welds that meet minimum size
	requirements, and enable recording of weld size so that overwelding
	can be identified and reduced. The technology would also allow tracking
	of weld quality and statistical analysis of welding process capability
	to support lean/six-sigma continuous improvement initiatives. A prototype
	system was assembled and field tested by inspecting actual ship structures.
	The equipment evaluated has potential, but needs both hardware and
	software modifications before it can be used as a tool on a regular
	basis in a shipbuilding environment. As is, it will be useful as
	an audit tool to gauge the health of the visual inspection process
	and to further document the inherent variability of the visual inspection
	process. Recommendations were made for improvements to refine the
	prototype tool prior to broader deployment.},

	and industry, pair programming, two programmers collaborating on
	design, coding and testing, has become a controversial focus of interest.
	Many researchers and practitioners remain skeptical of claims for
	the productivity of pair programming. Three controlled experiments,
	by Nosek, William, and Nawrocki, all reported statistical productivity
	measurements, but the results were inconsistent and the differences
	among the results could not be explained because there exists no
	theoretical framework to articulate pair programming. This paper
	proposes a cognitive model that describes the programming mechanism
	and this in turn can be used to explain why and when a pair may outperform
	two individuals. The model helps explain discrepancies in the results
	of the above-mentioned experiments. To show how the proposed model
	can be applied, a psychological experiment was conducted in which
	twenty-two programmers who were informed only of the experiment and
	the results of Nosek, and of the descriptions of Williams and Nawrocki,
	were able to use our model to predict the possible outcomes of the
	experiments of Williams and Nawrocki.},

	13 student teams were required to develop an almost real project

	collected in order to measure the amount of work completed, compliance
	with the release and iteration plans, and ability of effort estimation,
	thus contributing to evidence-based assessment of the typical Scrum
	processes. It was found that the initial plans and effort estimates
	were over-optimistic, but the abilities of estimating and planning
	improved from Sprint to Sprint. Most teams were able to define almost
	accurate Sprint plans after three Sprints. In the third Sprint the
	velocity stabilized and the actual achievement almost completely
	matched the plan.},

  abstract = {This report presents some important factors related to safety-critical
	software in machinery. The following subjects are considered in the
	text, bearing in mind the subject: The role of safety-critical software
	in machinery, statistics of software faults, requirements, safety
	and security principles, risk and hazard modelling, agile development,
	safety process patterns, safety-related architectures, verification
	and validation, phases of development and formal methods. The general
	observation is that there are many methods for software design and
	it is difficult to choose the most relevant ones. The report shows
	some criteria for selecting methods and some aspects related to current
	topics. There are so many different safety-critical software applications
	in machinery that the research found the most interesting topics
	and then focused on them. The statistics show that most defects arise
	during the requirements specification and architectural design phases
	of the lifecycle. This is before any coding. The statistics also
	show that the defect density is higher in large programs, i.e. the
	number of defects increases exponentially as the program size grows.
	It may therefore be better to separate safety-critical and standard
	code in order to keep the first one small. The separation of modules
	and keeping the connections between modules under control and narrow
	is recommended in order to have advantages in testing, understanding
	of the program, limited error spreading, program development etc.
	There are many kinds of self-diagnostic and monitoring functions
	that may be complex and increase the number of defects, but they
	increase safety and are needed in safety-critical code. The standard
	IEC 61508-3, published in 2010, lays down many functional requirements
	for safetycritical programmable systems. However, there are also
	other standards related to functional safety and the safety of control
	systems. This paper also considers some aspects related to the safety
	of agile methods. The standards show the requirements related to
	the phases of the V-model, but agile methods are not considered.
	The functional safety of software is achieved through systematic
	(not intuitional) use of adequate methods in all phases of the programmable
	system lifecycle. Programmable systems contain hardware and software,
	both of which need to be considered in the validation process. Copyright

  abstract = {As information technology continues to evolve, analysis of material
	presented in a curriculum requires constant monitoring. Courses in
	information technology have been in high demand in educational institutions
	nationwide. In light of these demands information systems programs
	have identified a critical need to incorporate more systems and network
	administration into their curricula. The students who are progressing
	towards a B.S. in Information Systems Technology (IST) are the primary
	audience of the course detailed in this paper. The increasing use
	of virtual technologies by companies across multiple industries has
	made it extremely important for IT programs to provide students with
	experience using virtual technologies. As the virtual technology
	market evolves, it is important to monitor and report the changes
	through course material. Due to the growth in networking and virtual
	technologies and the need for undergraduate students in non-networking
	majors to understand and learn about network protocols, network operating
	system fundamentals, network operating systems, database and web
	servers and directory services, a course for IST students was developed.
	To meet the practical objectives of the course, students require
	dedicated computers on which to install operating systems and applications.
	However, providing each lab group a dedicated machine would be space
	and cost prohibitive. By using VMware as the platform, students are
	able to gain hands-on laboratory experience that emphasizes networking
	and systems software problem solving and troubleshooting skills through
	installation and configuration of network operating systems as well
	as application software. The course laboratory activities currently
	include one-week on VMware orientation, three-weeks on Windows XP
	Pro and Windows 2003 Server, three-weeks on SQL Server 2005 and Internet
	Information Server (IIS), three-weeks on Exchange Server 2003, and
	the last five-weeks of the semester cover Linux and Apache Web Server.
	This paper will discuss the course design including lecture and laboratory
	activities, the challenges associated with the laboratory activities,
	as well as the pros and cons with using VMware. Â© American Society

  abstract = {Recent developments in numerical techniques and computational processing
	power now permit time-dependent, multi-dimensional computational
	fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations with reduced chemical kinetic mechanisms
	(approx. 20 species and 100 reactions). Such computations have the
	potential to be highly effective tools for designing lean-burn, high
	BMEP natural gas engines that achieve high fuel efficiency and low
	emissions. Specifically, these CFD simulations can provide the analytical
	tools required to design highly optimized natural gas engine components
	such as pistons, intake ports, precombustion chambers, fuel systems
	and ignition systems. To accurately model the transient, multi-dimensional
	chemically reacting flows present in these systems, chemical kinetic
	mechanisms are needed that accurately reproduce measured combustion
	data at high pressures and lean conditions, but are of sufficient
	size to enable reasonable computational times. Presently these CFD
	models cannot be used as accurate design tools for application in
	high BMEP lean-burn gas engines because existing detailed and reduced
	mechanisms fail to accurately reproduce experimental flame speed
	and ignition delay data for natural gas at high pressure (40 atm
	and higher) and lean (0.6 equivalence ratio (<) and lower) conditions.
	Existing methane oxidation mechanisms have typically been validated
	with experimental conditions at atmospheric and intermediate pressures
	(1 to 20 atm) and relatively rich stoichiometry. These kinetic mechanisms
	are not adequate for CFD simulation of natural gas combustion in
	which elevated pressures and very lean conditions are typical. This
	paper provides an analysis, based on experimental data, of the laminar
	flame speed computed from numerous, detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms
	for methane combustion at pressures and equivalence ratios necessary
	for accurate high BMEP, lean-burn natural gas engine modeling. A
	reduced mechanism that was shown previously to best match data at
	moderately lean and high pressure conditions was updated for the
	conditions of interest by performing sensitivity analysis using CHEMKIN.
	The reaction rate constants from the most sensitive reactions were
	appropriately adjusted in order to obtain a better agreement at high
	pressure lean conditions. An evaluation of this adjusted mechanism,
	"MD19", was performed using Converge CFD software. The results were
	compared to engine data and a remarkable improvement on combustion
	performance prediction was obtained with the MD19 mechanism. Copyright

  abstract = {Hydrogen is considered to be the fuel of future as it's use does not
	lead to CO, CO 2 hydrocarbon (HC) emission. It can he used in existing
	internal combustion engines, yielding unprecedented efficiencies
	and extremely low levels of exhaust pollution. Hydrogen can be used
	in conjunction with compact liquid fuels such as gasoline, alcohol
	or diesel provided each is stored separately. The drawback of lean
	operation with hydrocarbon fuels is a reduced power output. Lean
	operation of hydrocarbon engines has additional drawbacks. Lean mixtures
	are hard to ignite 1. Mixing hydrogen with other hydrocarbon fuels
	reduces all these drawbacks. Hydrogen's low ignition energy limit
	and high burning speed makes the hydrogen/ hydrocarbon mixture easier
	to ignite, reducing misfire and thereby improving emissions, performance
	and fuel economy. The engine used in the present study was a Kirloskar
	AV-1, single cylinder direct injection diesel engine. Diesel was
	injected through a nozzle of hole size 0.15mm. A CNG injector (to
	inject simultaneously hydrogen directly in to the cylinder) was also
	provided. The engine was coupled to a dc dynamometer. The engine
	was modified and provision was made to vary the compression ratio
	from 14.5 to 24.5. A computer interfaced piezo sensor, of range (2000
	psi) was used to note the pressure inside the cylinder. Special software
	was used to obtain combustion parameters related with pressure inside
	the cylinder. The hydrogen gas was inducted into the intake manifold
	and a thermal mass flow controller controlled its flow rate. The
	pressure of hydrogen which was at 150 bars inside the cylinder was
	reduced to atmospheric pressure before inducting it into the manifold.
	The airflow rate was measured using a laminar flow element. The speed
	of the engine was maintained constant by controlling the hydrogen
	gas mass flow rate. Emissions were measured using an advanced AVL
	five-gas analyzer. All the tests were conducted at a constant speed
	of 1400 rev/min, at various loads rangingfrom 20% to 100% of full
	load. The injection timing of diesel was varied from 40Â° BTDC to
	5Â° ATDC. During the experiments heating the air in the intake charge
	tank varied the inlet temperature of the air. The temperature was
	measured after the hydrogen was mixed with air in the inlet manifold.},

	based on research being conducted at the MSI Research Institute,
	Loughborough University. In collaboration with Krause GmbH and Lamb
	Technicon UK Ltd two full size demonstrator machines have been commissioned
	to evaluate a Component Based control system and its associated design
	environment The Krause machine consists of a transport system and
	a tappet assembly station, the Lamb Technicon machine consists of
	a single station from a transfer line machine for cylinder head machining.
	The framework for HMI System's described in this paper meets the
	requirements that automated manufacturing production machines face
	from the emerging agile manufacturing paradigm. Machines must be
	able to respond quickly to continuous change by many globally distributed
	engineering partners. This facilitates visibility of the system common
	model to all the globally distributed engineering partners involved
	in a given project. Within the C-B framework, HMI systems are composed
	from instances of reusable software templates that are targeted at
	specific user types. User targeted operator interfaces offer a common
	look and feel that improves usability. The machine's configuration
	is achieved by populating a series of HMI templates to produce a
	complete machine HMI system. A thin-client architecture is used based
	on server / client internet technologies that allow the machine HMI
	to be executed on any internet enabled computer using a standard
	web browser. It is possible to drive both the real machine and a
	simulated 3D virtual machine model via the HMI, enabling engineers
	to be trained on the operation of the HMI prior to the real machine
	being completed.},

	This paper has outlined literature discussing various CMC styles
	as they exist within current CMC tools, particularly in gender-related
	communication style differences indicated that the current 'lean'
	text-based electronic communication systems tend to promote a more
	direct 'report' communication style. Because a learner's CMC style
	may influence or impact the recipient's view of the message and/or
	the sender, and with so many online learners now utilising computer
	mediated communication for personal and group communication, it would
	seem prudent for learners to be aware of, monitor, and perhaps strategically
	utilise their communication styles that benefit them in being more
	effective in their CMC. It is concluded that learners should be familiar

	to the signal processing requirement, modem functions are partitioned
	into hardware and software. At the same time, a layered modem architecture
	which is a kind of multiprocessor architecture is proposed. This
	architecture can perform parallel processing by plural CPU cores,
	and therefore, it can lower the CPU clock and make software simple.
	We consider the support service switching possibility for further
	discussion. Moreover we have developed an evaluation board system.
	Referring to the implementation results, we discuss hardware complexity
	and the amount of memory from the viewpoint of LSI development.},

  abstract = {The benefits that a software organization obtains from estimates of
	product quality are dependent upon how early in the product cycle
	that these estimates are available. Early estimation of software
	quality can help organizations make informed decisions about corrective
	actions. To provide such early estimates we present an empirical
	case study of two large scale commercial operating systems, Windows
	XP and Windows Server 2003. In particular, we leverage various historical
	in-process and product metrics from Windows XP binaries to create
	statistical predictors to estimate the post-release failures/failure-proneness
	of Windows Server 2003 binaries. These models estimate the failures
	and failure-proneness of Windows Server 2003 binaries at statistically
	significant levels. Our study is unique in showing that historical
	predictors for a software product line can be useful, even at the
	very large scale of the Windows operating system. Â© 2006 IEEE.},

	defined radios (SASDR) will be equipped with advanced radio frequency
	(RF) sensors that will enable them to sense their environment and
	adaptively select the best and most stable portions of the spectrum
	to establish communications. This paper presents a robust method
	for estimating locally the unused or underutilized regions of RF
	spectrum to optimize dynamic spectrum usage. These adaptive algorithms
	are described and results of "Open Spectrum" estimation performed
	on real RF spectrum measurements illustrate the robust performance
	of the approach. Simulation results are shown along with results
	from real measurements that describe the RF resources in rural, suburban
	and urban areas in and around Philadelphia in the VHF and UHF bands.
	The measurements represent a good dynamic data set including motion
	and spatio-temporal diversity. The effect on reducing the risk of
	interference by collaborating across multiple nodes that provides
	increased robustness of sensing of open spectrum through spatial
	diversity is also discussed and quantitative values for the interference
	mitigation under collaborative behaviors are also presented. Â© 2005

	demand novel approaches to attitude control and dynamics. The paradigm
	of ever stiffer, ever more massive designs is likely to give way
	to active, passive, and/or hybrid active/passive structural control
	of payloads with soft, well-damped bus-to-payload interfaces. Agility,
	often achieved through the use of control-moment gyros (CMGs), can
	also benefit from the highly damped, readily predictable dynamics
	characteristic of this new paradigm. Honeywell is developing a spacecraft
	attitude-dynamics testbed that is designed to assist in research,
	demonstration, and validation of hardware and software architectures
	for such spacecraft. The testbed offers high-agility slew and scan
	capability (via six CMGs) with structural control (via active vibration-isolation
	and payloadsteering platforms and discrete high-performance structural
	dampers). The combination of a line-of-sight metrology system capable
	of sub-microradian resolution and a large range-of-motion spherical
	airbearing offers a unique environment for testing innovative controls
	and dynamics concepts in spacecraft design.},

	of conceptualizing the delta in requirement and modeling it, in order

	or informal change. While agile methodology facilitates informal
	change, the approach discussed in this paper seeks to develop the
	idea of facilitating formal change. To collect, document meta-requirements

	The simplicity of this formulation is also helpful for circuit design.
	Approximate expressions for the corner frequencies of the spectrum
	are determined, identifying the most influential magnitudes and deriving
	design criteria. In particular, a technique has been developed to
	shift the frequency of the first corner of the phase-noise spectrum,

	for the corner frequencies can be introduced in either in-house or
	commercial harmonic-balance software, thus allowing an agile design,
	as no separate phase-noise analysis is required. The validity of
	the analytical techniques is verified with the conversion-matrix
	approach and with measurements using two field-effect-transistor-based

  abstract = {This work examines the blocking performance of narrowband (NB) and
	wideband (WB) sources that access a shared pool of wireless channels.
	The NB sources utilize a single channel, whereas WB sources access
	simultaneously a larger group of channels. This system is analyzed
	in the context of maximizing the utilization of spectrum that is
	allocated to the WB system by allowing NB sources random access to
	the same spectrum. The performance measure to be controlled is the
	blocking experienced by WB sources. A queueing model of this system
	is proposed that allows evaluation of the impact of NB sources on
	WB performance. Assuming Poisson arrival process models and negative
	exponential distributions for the channel holding times, the dependence
	of the blocking probability of the WB source is derived as a function
	of the NB utilization factor. In an uncontrolled NB access scheme,
	the WB blocking is lower bounded by the blocking probability experienced
	by NB sources. The performance improvement afforded by adding extra
	NB channels and by controlling the access rates of the NB source
	for finite population WB sources is presented. The analysis presented
	here provides an assessment of some of the emerging paradigms for
	adaptive spectrum allocation. Of particular interest are the criteria
	under which spectrum agile, cognitive and software radios functioning
	in an opportunistic fashion can access unused spectrum allocated
	to a primary system without adversely affecting the performance of
	the primary system.},

	combustor is investigated experimentally by high-speed imaging. Ignition
	testing is conducted at two operating conditions: a 'safe' point
	at which relight is possible, and an 'unsafe' condition where ignition
	is precluded by the large air mass flow rate. Image processing software
	has been developed to analyze the motion and breakup of the imaged
	flame. At the safe condition, the developing flame kernels are typically
	swept downstream and towards the fuel-injector center-line, before
	moving upstream. The comparatively large gas-phase velocity at the
	unsafe condition causes rapid disintegration of the ignition kernel.
	At neither condition does the size of the spark kernel determine
	ignition outcome. Good agreement is demonstrated between the measured
	spark-centroid velocity and CFD predictions of gas-phase velocity

	An agile method is a new product development process that is often

	characterized by factors of iterative development, customer feedback,
	well-structured teams, and flexibility. Use of agile methods may
	improve software quality by injecting customer feedback into a stream

	250 software professionals were used to help determine whether the
	use of agile methods improves the quality of Internet websites. The
	central contributions of this study include conceptual models, survey

  abstract = {Railcar condition directly affects the safety, the efficiency, and
	the reliability of freight railroad operations. Current railcar inspection
	practices are intended to identify defects before failure, but these
	practices generally do not enable preventive maintenance because
	manual, visual inspection is inherently limited. As a result, automated
	wayside conditionmonitoring technologies have been developed to monitor
	rolling stock condition and facilitate predictive maintenance strategies.
	Improving the effectiveness of monitoring of railcar conditions could
	substantially reduce in-service failures and derailments, operational
	waste, and variability in rail operations and could enhance network
	productivity, capacity, and reliability. An analysis of the effect
	of lean production methods on main-line railway operations was conducted
	to determine the potential impact of improved railcar inspection
	and maintenance practices made possible by new, automated wayside
	technologies. Dispatch simulation software was used to quantify the
	magnitude and the variability of train delay as a function of both
	traffic level and severity of service outage. The results indicated
	that the annual cost caused by main-line delay was substantial compared

  abstract = {Following on from the author's reviews of the stability and control
	of motorcycles in 1978 and 1985, the paper treats the earlier material
	in tutorial fashion and adds more recent information. Fixed and free
	control properties are compared and it is concluded essential to
	the operation of a motorcycle that the steering system is free. Motorcycles
	typically possess lightly damped oscillatory modes and the properties
	of these modes are discussed. Small perturbations from straight line
	motion and from cornering equilibrium states are treated. Steering
	control by handlebar torque and by rider upper body lean torque are
	compared. The behaviour of the rider as an extension of the structure
	of the machine and as a controller is also discussed. Theoretical
	analysis, experimental measurements and general experience are linked
	as far as possible. More recent years have seen a strong movement
	towards the use of structurally efficient frames for large motorcycles,
	in particular, and multibody dynamics software for h andling analysis.
	Theoretical predictions can be extended in ways hardly possible before
	automated multibody analysis became available. The state of the art
	is illustrated with a description of a contemporary motorcycle /
	rider model and some results which are derived from it. Directions
	for future work are indicated.},

  abstract = {During the past decade, the Internet, Web and intelligent agents have
	been used in attempts to implement distributed intelligent manufacturing
	systems. Network communication and message services are important
	aspects for such systems. This paper first introduces a new concept
	called iShopFloor-an intelligent shop floor based on the Internet,
	Web and agent technologies. The paper then reports some of our recent
	work on the implementation of XML-based message services for Internet-enabled,
	agent-based, intelligent shop floors. The objective is to investigate
	XML for message exchanges among Internet-enabled shop floor devices
	that are represented by intelligent agents. The paper discusses the
	advantages of using XML for message services and presents our initial
	implementation within the iShopFloor prototype environment. This
	implementation has demonstrated the following advantages of using
	XML-based message services on the shop floor: (1) simplification
	and standardization of message services in Internet-based, intelligent
	shop floors; (2) facilitation of the integration of an agent-based
	scheduling system with other intelligent shop floor systems, including
	Web-based shop floor monitoring and control systems; and (3) possibility
	of creating data views on the fly. Â© 2005 IJAM.},

  abstract = {There exists a growing need in the DOD for a tactical or responsive
	space asset to support real-time battlefield intelligence, surveillance,
	and reconnaissance. The desired attributes include being: 1. Responsive
	- deployable in days; 2. Affordable - expendable tactical resources
	at a cost comparable to other tactical systems; 3. Employable - assets
	must support the Joint Force Commander (JFC); 4. Integrated space/air/terrestrial
	system-of-systems - full network connectivity, bandwidth on demand,
	and augment other assets. To the warfighter, a responsive space asset
	would provide the capability to respond to unanticipated military
	needs in days, providing flexibility of response to rapidly field
	tailored payloads and coverage. This capability could also provide
	rapid reconstitution after a loss from attack or failure and counteract
	enemy adaptation, through denial or deception, to existing space
	capabilities. Most importantly the short deployment times and low
	cost would provide the United States a means for efficiently using
	the versatility, and relative safety of space to provide real-time
	support to the war fighter. To be responsive the space element must
	possess a modular design supporting "plug and play" (PnP) architecture,
	leveraging commercial parts and standards. Lending itself to a lean
	production and integration environment, again utilizing standard
	interfaces and taking advantage of prequalified, inventoried subsystems.
	Rapid deployment of these elements will make use of "canned" mission
	planning tools, tailored orbits for a given theater, built-in health
	& status monitoring, and autonomous test and checkout software and
	operations. The two emerging responsive mission objectives include
	space control and tailored, tactical intelligence, surveillance,
	reconnaissance (ISR Space control involves a situational awareness
	to sense threats against, and provide protection for, US space assets.
	The tailored, tactical missions offer high tempo ISR operations such
	as target characterization and emitter location in theater, perform
	real-time blue force tracking, and provide gap-filler, specialized
	communications support. The challenge is to develop and quality the
	satellite technologies and rapid integration and test processes to
	support an operational responsive system in the next five years.
	Under an Air Force Research Laboratory SBIR program, MicroSat Systems
	is developing a PnP testbed to enable an operational responsive capability
	through development and ground validation of the various elements.
	Those elements include the mission definition and CONOPS specification
	processes, space segment, and the operational prioritization, tasking,
	processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PTPED) process/infrastructure.
	Specific to providing an end-to-end mission simulation, the testbed
	should be equipped with the modeling and simulation tools to develop
	tactical satellite CONOPS and provide the warfighter with a front
	end tool for training. To validate utility to the end-user the testbed
	must be equipped with the capability to simulate the data processing
	and dissemination infrastructure envisioned to provide the battlefield
	commander with real-time data. The space segment of the testbed should
	consist of the hardware and software elements required to simulate
	the operations of a fully functional satellite system. The approach
	to developing a responsive mission testbed includes defining requirements,
	hardware/software architecture, technology development roadmap, starting
	with a core capability, and incrementally integrating and validating
	the developing components and processes as they emerge. Â© 2005 IEEE.},

	project, LIMOUSINE (Limit cycles of thermo-acoustic oscillations
	in gas turbine combustors), a model test burner has been built in
	order to have reproducible experimental results for model validation.
	The burner consists of a Rijke tube of rectangular section having

	A 2-D section has been modelled by means of the scale resolving turbulence
	model, Scale-Adaptive Simulation (SAS), and a two-step Eddy Dissipation

  abstract = {Purpose - Petri net (PN) and queuing theory are used in performance
	analysis of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS). They are used
	to determine the FMS measures of performance. These measures of performance
	include optimal work-in-process (WIP), lead time, production rate,
	machine utilization, and number of servers at each station. The purpose
	of this paper is to present a comparison between PN and queuing network
	tools to determine the optimum values for FMS measures of performance.
	Design/methodology/approach - PN model with dual kanban and closed
	queuing network are used for analysis and performance evaluation
	of FMS. Integrated network analyzer and Lingo softwares are used
	for performance evaluation of FMS by PN tool. CANQ software is used
	for performance evaluation of FMS by queuing network. In both the
	approaches, the throughput is bounded by the utilization of the bottleneck
	machines. Findings - The comparison shows that for the given number
	of servers, PN gives better values of performance measures for FMS.
	The PN optimization gives minimum WIP corresponding to the maximum
	production rate. Minimum WIP leads to minimum lead time. Research
	limitations/implications - The results are concluded based on one
	case study. In future research, the results may be achieved by doing
	more case studies with different numbers of system parameters and/or
	parameter settings. Practical implications - Using the PN model,
	the production manager may design, analyze, evaluate, and even optimize
	the layout of the production system for minimum WIP, maximum throughput,
	and reduced lead time. The determination of the total WIP, total
	number of stations in the production system, and the number of servers
	at each station may be helpful in shop floor management. It may result
	in more production efficiency along with ease of supervision. Originality/value

  abstract = {This paper discusses a Multi-Agent System (MAS) core developed for
	an Intelligent Environment (IE) application. MAS poses features like
	distributed control, cooperative decision making, and remote monitoring
	which make it suitable for IE applications. The proposed MAS consists
	of four intelligent components namely accumulative personal preferences
	learning, intelligent resources allocation, reactive controls and
	context-aware proactive controls. It directly interacts with the
	occupants of the IE and interfaces with the underlying physical device
	control software. The tool used to develop the MAS is called JADE
	(Java Agent DEvelopment Framework), a FIPA (Foundation of Intelligent
	Physical Agent)-compliant development framework. It contains a group
	of libraries to assist the development of MASs, a platform independent
	runtime environment and a set of graphical tools for monitoring and
	debugging the designed system. The preliminary MAS core is developed
	and tested in Windows XP environment and is implemented only with
	simple reactive controls. At later stage of the research, the reactive
	controls will be strengthened and other intelligent components will
	be added to complete the system. The ultimate goal of this project
	is to achieve a fully integrated proactive control system via context-aware,
	cooperative multi-agent learning and decision making.},

	stages of the overall product development to both the New Product
	Introduction (NPI) and Production Release processes. For NPI, companies
	must create test systems to support product validation and verification.
	For manufacturing companies, ongoing process metrics are used to
	ensure the product meets quality specifications and can be sold to
	customers. This entire test process is time consuming and resource
	intensive and therefore negatively impacts the overall product net
	revenue, both in terms of time to market and in terms of development
	resources. Large and successful companies invest hundreds of thousands
	of dollars in automated test systems to support product development.
	Such infrastructures provide a competitive advantage by enabling
	a systematic methodology to generate test plans and then automatically
	have the test plan flow through the test software and hardware development,
	test and data collection, and results analysis phases. The Automatic
	Testing Equipment (ATE) industry has pushed to develop a framework
	that supports the sharing of test information, data, and analysis
	results across various enterprise platforms. An IEEE standard know
	as Automatic Test Markup Language (ATML), comprising of an XML schema,
	was proposed and developed in order to allow interoperability of
	test case, data, equipment information, and results. Our methodology
	provides a Service-Oriented Architecture that provides an interoperable
	solution. Users can begin with a test plan, deploy a scalable data
	monitoring and analysis capability, and follow the process from NPI
	through production. Various additional capabilities such as advanced
	analysis capability, customer data sharing resources, test software
	generation and deployment, closed and open source software library
	access, test station monitoring and equipment tracking, automated
	reporting schedules, and others are among the possibilities that
	can be added to the overall process. The proposed architecture is
	entirely scalable and can be deployed in single-site or global applications
	and may be installed behind corporate firewalls or in the cloud.

	the Planning Game, the Iteration Planning Game, test driven development,
	stand-up meetings and pair programming. We start the course with
	two weeks of controlled lab exercises designed to teach the students
	about test driven development in JUnit/Eclipse and designing for
	testability (with the humble dialog box design pattern) while practicing
	pair programming. The rest of our semester is spent in three four-week
	iterations developing a product for a customer. Our teams are generally
	large (14-16 students) so that the projects can be large enough to
	motivate the use of configuration management and defect tracking
	tools. The requirement of pair programming limits the amount of project
	work the students can do outside of class, so class time is spent
	on the projects and teaching is on-demand individual mentoring with
	lectures/labs inserted as necessary. One significant challenge in
	managing this course is tracking individual responsibilities and
	activities to ensure that all of the students are fully engaged in
	the project. To accomplish this, we have modified the story and task
	cards from XP to provide feedback to the students and track individual
	performance against goals as part of the students' grades. The resulting
	course has been well received by the students. This paper will describe
	this course in more detail and assess its effect on students' software
	engineering background through students' feedback and code metrics.

	Software Metrics/Project Management. In the first two courses, the
	students work in teams to develop products for customers using two
	disciplined, but very different, processes (a variation of TSP[3]

	courses, the students work on large projects in teams of 14 to 16
	students using variants of Team Software Process (TSP) or Extreme
	Programming (XP). In order to compare the students' experiences with
	these methodologies, the team in the plan-driven course and one of
	the agile teams were given the same problem statement. Throughout
	the semester, we measured team cohesion and individuals' attachment
	to the project. To measure team cohesion, we modified the Group Environment
	Questionnaire that has been shown to accurately reflect team cohesion
	in sports teams. We also developed some of our own cohesion metrics
	and a measure of attachment to the project. While the GEQ showed
	no significant difference between the teams, our measures showed
	higher overall cohesion in XP, but higher sub-team cohesion in TSP.
	At the end of the semester, we also compared the functionality of
	the applications the teams developed and a variety of code metrics
	measuring the quality of their code and its design. While the team's
	developed approximately the same amount of functionality, in general,
	the XP team's code had better metrics. The TSP team required much
	more code to accomplish the same functionality because, although
	they had a strong design, their implementation did not leverage inheritance
	as the design expected. Â© 2005 IEEE.},

	This highly reconfigurable and frequency agile block is designed
	to be used as an envelope modulator in a wideband multi-standard
	polar transmitter. Each path is composed of a 12-bit DPA ensuring
	the modulation of the envelope of the RF signal. The DPAs are controlled
	by envelope code words (ECW) at different sample rates. This diversity
	strongly attenuates the images produced by the direct digital to
	RF conversion, avoiding passive filtering. The baseband sample rate
	conversion can easily be reconfigured. The proposed front-end can
	manage spurious emissions depending on the standard, the carrier
	frequency and the required power. The DPAs also integrate active
	input impedance compensation cells in order to limit the input impedance
	modulation when switching the DPA cells. The two-path DPA covers
	a 0.9-1.9 GHz bandwidth with 16.7dBm output 1dB compression point
	and 12.4% PAE. 64-QAM presents -28dB EVM while active area occupies

  abstract = {Have you decided to "Lean" your organization but are not sure where
	to start? Eliminating waste from your organization's processes can
	produce tremendous savings that you can pass along to your customers.
	Knowing where to start is not always an easy task. Program management
	provides a good starting point to help establish and work toward
	your strategic objectives, and Lean provides the improvement tools
	to help you achieve that. This presentation will provide an overview
	of program management methodologies and how they apply to successfully
	implement Lean transformation. In order to have a successful Lean
	transformation, the entire scope of the program needs to be evaluated
	from the beginning. Program management starts at the beginning and
	creates an assessment of the entire organization. These methodologies
	help align an organization's overall health and manage the entire
	life cycle of the transformation. They (methodologies) help analyze
	your program's risks, determine costs and returns on investments,
	and develop your action plan and milestones. Developing a proper
	plan can guide you through the improvement process. Outlining the
	reasons for needing improvement should be the first step in addressing
	why you need to incorporate Lean into your processes. Your reasons
	should be commensurate with the strategic goals of the organization.
	This is known as the conception phase, where the idea begins. Do
	you know what your expected benefits are? What are the goals? Is
	it worth the investment? Is it feasible? Do you have adequate resources?
	Next is the definition phase; this is where your planning is critical
	to success. Reviewing your current baseline provides an idea of where
	you are. Using a "current-state map" is an excellent visual cue in
	determining how to prioritize your projects. During this phase a
	team should be identified with a sponsor and proper resources. There
	should be a charter or statement of work that outlines: the problem
	statement; project scope; background information; key measurements
	and targets; risks and benefits; and any assumptions that could affect
	project performance. The project manager or team leader will need
	to outline roles and responsibilities for all team members. Team
	member selection is vital to change because one naysayer can impede
	the progress or reduce enthusiasm. The start phase is where the rubber
	meets the road. Based on discovery in the definition phase, teams
	will measure and analyze data that is gathered. During this phase,
	numerous Lean and Six Sigma tools can be used, such as: value stream
	mapping and analysis; pareto charts; fishbone diagrams; control charts;
	failure mode effects analysis (FMEA); and regression and variance
	analyses. Identification of process capabilities, areas of waste
	and variability, and bottlenecks will become obvious in this phase.
	The performance or improvement phase requires commitment and buy-in
	from every person in the organization. Conducting experiments and
	developing action plans is where the actual improvements are seen,
	whether it is through a pull or kanban system; doing setup reduction
	on a production line; or using preventative maintenance on equipment.
	But the key to success is outlining schedules for completion and
	tracking the implementation. Using a software tool such as Microsoft
	Project is an excellent way to visually track progress and identify
	causes of delays or variances that may impact schedule performance
	and implementation of improvement activities. The last phase, the
	control phase, is never really "over," rather it is a work in progress.
	The program manager captures metrics and measurement of the improvements
	made and compares to the baseline. Sustaining the newly improved
	processes is the toughest part because it involves accepting change
	as the "new way of doing business." Program management tries to expect
	the unexpected and anticipate the issues before they arise or get
	out of hand. It customizes practical experience and expertise and
	applies it to each individual organization. Using these streamlined
	processes reduces costs and cycle time. Program management also increases
	productivity and quality of work. By using program management you
	can assure the success of the Lean transformation throughout the
	enterprise. The process is continual and always in need of review;
	it should become a natural part of "institutionalizing" process change
	in the organization.},

	spawning a VM dedicated to an OS reboot and enables the user to switch
	over to the rebooted state where the updated kernel and applications
	are ready for use. ShadowReboot provides an illusion to the users
	that the guest OS travels forward in time to the rebooted state where
	the updated kernel and applications are ready for use. ShadowReboot
	offers the following advantages. It can be applied to any patch to
	the kernels and even system configuration updates. Second, it does
	not need any special patch requiring intimate knowledge about the
	target kernels. Third, it does not require any target kernel modification.
	We implemented a prototype in VirtualBox 3.0.8 OSE. Our preliminary

	have to meet ever-tightening emission standards (mainly NOx, CO and
	UHC) while operating at high combustor pressures. This requires a
	detailed understanding of the physical processes involved. The air-fuel
	mixture preparation is a critical step in most advanced gas turbine
	combustion strategies to achieve lower emissions. It has long been
	established that the level of unmixedness between the fuel and air
	is strongly tied with NOx levels. The present paper applies the statistical
	technique of Design Of Experiments (DOE) to a generic mixer set-up
	that includes an axial swirler, with fuel injected at discrete locations
	and transverse to the flow. The objective is to identify influential
	design and operating parameters that will provide rapid and enhanced
	mixing. The parameters tested include Swirl strength as measured
	by the Swirl number, Swirl type (Constant angle vs. Free vortex),
	number and momentum of fuel injection sites and gas temperature.
	Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence of acetone (PLIF) was used to quantify
	mixing at various planar locations in the mixing section. Commercial
	CFD software is used to model the flow field and predict the spatial
	mixing at selected conditions. Comparisons are made with experimental
	measurements with the aim to validate the CFD code and also on comparing
	the model results with the measurements.},

  abstract = {No one questions that SPC is a useful tool that can bring improvements
	to any process. The reason it is not used more extensively or effectively
	is a widely held (but seldom voiced) feeling that it is just "more
	trouble than it is worth." To counter this sentiment, the real savings
	(in dollars) that will accrue after proper implementation must be
	focused upon.4 â¢ It is necessary to properly implement SPC techniques
	to achieve its full benefits. This requires the proper and appropriate
	measurement of the actual, critical process parameters that determine
	quality - not just the ones that are "easy" to measure. Where actual
	physical measurements are impossible, correlated models based on
	real-time indirect measurements can provide a cost-effective solution.
	â¢ Perhaps the most critical factor in reaping the benefits of an
	SPC program is the requirement for real-time analysis of measurement
	data and clear output directly to the operator of the results, including
	trends, warnings and alarms. This is the area that most commonly
	is overlooked or underdeveloped in the industry and it primarily
	is a software issue. Data collection and analysis must proceed automatically,
	permitting operators or supervisors to perform their normal functions.
	Furthermore, the system must be robust and reliable enough for all
	personnel to be confident that when a warning or alarm occurs, something
	really is wrong and requires action. â¢ Dedicated and fully integrated
	software packages can provide the best solution to the problems of
	making SPC work in today's "lean and mean" production environment.
	Because of the multitasking that is expected at all levels, a staff
	has limited time. An independently developed third party package,
	for example, that is dedicated to a specific application can provide
	the out of box, complete functionality required without significant
	setup operations or programming (learning) by in-house personnel.},

  abstract = {Middleware technologies such as Web Services, CORBA and DCOM have
	been very successful in solving distributed computing problems for
	a large family of application domains. As middleware systems are
	getting widely adopted and more functionally mature, it is also increasingly
	difficult for the architecture of middleware to achieve a high level
	of adaptability and configurability, due to the limitations of traditional
	software decomposition methods. Aspect oriented programming has brought
	us new design perspectives because it permits the superimpositions
	of multiple abstraction models on top of one another. It is a very
	powerful technique in separating and simplifying design concerns.
	In this paper, we first show that, through the quantification of
	aspects in the legacy implementations, the modularity of middleware
	architecture is greatly hindered by the ubiquitous existence of tangled
	logic. We then go one step further by factoring out a number of aspects
	identified in the mining work and re-implementing them as aspect
	programs. The aspect oriented re-factorization allows us to apply
	a set of software engineering metrics to quantify the changes of
	the re-factored system in both the structural complexity and the
	runtime performance. The aspect oriented re-factoring proves that
	the aspect oriented programming is capable of composing orthogonal
	design requirements. The final "woven" system is able to correctly
	provide both the fundamental functionality and the "aspectized" functionality
	with negligible overhead and a leaner architecture. Further more,
	the configurability of middleware is dramatically increased because
	the "aspectized" features can be configured in and out during the
	compile-time.},

	for the protection of human life and health, the environment, and
	of the vested economic value. The correct functioning of those systems
	has a profound impact also on production cost and product quality.
	The early detection of faults is critical in avoiding performance
	degradation and damage to the machinery or human life. Accurate diagnosis
	then helps to make the right decisions on emergency actions and repairs.
	Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) has developed into a major area
	of research, at the intersection of systems and control engineering,
	artificial intelligence, applied mathematics and statistics, and
	such application fields as chemical, electrical, mechanical and aerospace
	engineering. IFAC has recognized the significance of FDD by launching
	a triennial symposium series dedicated to the subject. The SAFEPROCESS
	Symposium is organized every three years since the first symposium
	held in Baden-Baden in 1991. SAFEPROCESS 2006, the 6th IFAC Symposium
	on Fault Detection, Supervision and Safety of Technical Processes
	was held in Beijing, PR China. The program included three plenary
	papers, two semi-plenary papers, two industrial talks by internationally
	recognized experts and 258 regular papers, which have been selected
	out of a total of 387 regular and invited papers submitted. * Discusses
	the developments and future challenges in all aspects of fault diagnosis
	and fault tolerant control * 8 invited and 36 contributed sessions

	provides IDS with a whole view of the file system of the monitored
	VM. We show how to use a tool and some file system knowledge to enable
	the virtual disk to maintain a sector-to-file mapping table (called
	file-aware block level storage) as well as how to detect the changes
	to file content on-line. Based on these features, normal file-level
	intrusion detection (ID) rules can be converted to sector-level ones
	in order to integrate ID functions to the virtual storage. We implement
	such a prototype based on QEMU VMM and the OS of VM is Windows XP.
