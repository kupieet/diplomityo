  abstract = {Malware is at the root of a large number of information security breaches.
	Despite widespread effort devoted to combating malware, current techniques
	have proven to be insufficient in stemming the incessant growth in
	malware attacks. In this paper, we describe a tool that exploits
	a combination of virtualized (isolated) execution environments and
	dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) to detect malicious software
	and prevent its execution. We define two isolated environments: (i)
	a Testing environment, wherein an untrusted program is traced during
	execution using DBI and subjected to rigorous checks against extensive
	security policies that express behavioral patterns of malicious software,
	and (ii) a Real environment, wherein a program is subjected to run-time
	monitoring using a behavioral model (in place of the security policies),
	along with a continuous learning process, in order to prevent non-permissible
	behavior. We have evaluated the proposed methodology on both Linux
	and Windows XP operating systems, using several virus benchmarks
	as well as obfuscated versions thereof. Experiments demonstrate that
	our approach achieves almost complete coverage for original and obfuscated
	viruses. Average execution times go up to 28.57X and 1.23X in the
	Testing and Real environments, respectively. The high overhead imposed
	in the Testing environment does not create a severe impediment since
	it occurs only once and is transparent to the user. Users are only
	affected by the overhead imposed in the Real environment. We believe
	that our approach has the potential to improve on the state-of-the-art
	in malware detection, offering improved accuracy with low performance
	penalty. Â© 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Over the past few years, agile methods have recorded impressive results
	in the software engineering field basically in terms of business
	value and time to market. Similarly, software usability has been
	the major success factor for interactive systems. Agile usability
	engineering has been motivated as a booming solution to develop better
	usability in a cost-effective manner. eXtreme Scenario Based Design
	(XSBD) is one of the effective agile usability approaches. However,
	XSBD does not provide explicit metrics to quantify the software usability.
	In this paper, we propose the Quantified eXtreme Scenario Based Design
	(QXSBD) approach, which complements XSBD with a set of usability
	metrics collected from the agile architecture-centric approach and
	the Quality in Use Integrated Model (QUIM). Further, QXSBD specifies
	the subset of usability metrics that need to be assessed at the major
	milestones in agile process. This integration employs the Usability
	Critical Parameters Workshop (UCPW) to provide engineering practices
	defining the usability requirements and design goals. We demonstrate
	the QXSBD, process through customer request project case study. The
	obtained results have shown that usability issues have been reduced
	by about 30%. Noticeable end user satisfaction has been achieved
	while maintaining the project total cost. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

	us to engage the agile software development team members through
	vision, hearing and touch. In this way, BuildBot becomes an active
	part of the development process by bringing together human-robot
	interaction, human group dynamics and software engineering concepts
	through a number ofinteraction modalities. In this paper we describe
	the design and implementation ofthe BuildBot prototype, a robotic
	interface that can sense virtual stimuli, in this case the state
	of a software build, and react accordingly in a physical way via
	vision, sound and touch. We present an early evaluation comparing
	BuildBot to two other tools used by an agile team to monitor the
	continuous integration process. We also show preliminary results
	indicating that BuildBot may be more noticeable to the developers
	and contribute to a fun and lighthearted atmosphere. We argue that
	by increasing awareness of the state of the software build, BuildBot
	can assist in the self-supervision ofagile software engineering teams

  abstract = {This paper proposes an adaptive antenna tilting approach in an overlay
	UMTS FDD network. The purpose is to introduce and investigate an
	antenna element which can be remotely controlled by the radio network,
	in order to adequately cater for the spatial and temporal dynamic
	traffic distributions. The tilting angle is computed by a two level
	control mechanism: the higher level is controlled by the network
	manager and consists of a look-up table with the possible ranges
	(intervals or discrete steps for angles) of the antenna angle adjustments.
	The lower level is controlled by the element manager, e.g. RNC controlling
	and recording the track of the dynamic antenna changes. To enhance
	the system reliability, we associate the less dynamic traffic with
	the primary fixed tilt antenna, whereas the more varying traffic
	is controlled by a second more dynamically tilted antenna element.
	Through system level simulations, we show that significant gains
	in term of system capacity can be obtained. In addition, solutions
	involving the network management subsystem in UMTS FDD are also given,
	where the element management platform interacts with the performance
	measurement units. Intelligent inter-frequency handovers are deliberately
	discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an empirical study that examined the work climate
	within software development teams. The question was whether the team
	climate in software developer teams has any relation to software
	product quality. We define team climate as the shared perceptions
	of the team's work procedures and practices. The team climate factors
	examined were West and Anderson's participative safety, support for
	innovation, team vision and task orientation. These four factors
	were measured before the project using the Team Selection Inventory
	(TSI) test to establish subject climate preferences, as well as during
	and after the project using the Team Climate Inventory (TCI) test,
	which establishes the subject's perceptions of the climate. In this
	quasi-experimental study, data were collected from a sample of 35
	three-member developer teams in an academic setting. These teams
	were formed at random and their members were blind to the quasi-experimental
	conditions and hypotheses. All teams used an adaptation of extreme
	programming (XP) to the students' environment to develop the same
	software system. We found that high team vision preferences and high
	participative safety perceptions of the team were significantly related
	to better software. Additionally, the results show that there is
	a positive relationship between the categorization of better than
	preferred, as preferred and worse than preferred climate and software
	quality for two of the teamwork climate factors: participative safety
	and team vision. So it seems important to track team climate in an
	organization and team as one (of many) indicators of the quality
	of the software to be delivered. Â© 2008 Springer Science+Business

	because have light weight documentation and heavy intercommunications
	therefore reduce the delays of the traditional models. They emphasize
	customer satisfaction, fast response to changes, and release in less
	time. In the last decades, to achieve high quality of system, use
	the architecture as an important matter in the development process.
	Therefore using software architecture skills in agile methods could
	improve them toward producing a software system that has an appropriate
	structure because focuses on achieving quality attributes for a software
	system. This paper is a review on accomplished proceedings that combine
	software architecture and agile methods to improve Software developments.

  abstract = {The virtual manufacturing tools are usually equipped with digital
	human models for the simulation of manufacturing tasks. This enables
	designers to analyse alternative design solutions and to obtain ergonomic
	performance measures. An ergonomic assessment requires the availability
	of ergonomic analysis tools integrated into the virtual manufacturing
	process. This article presents ErgoToolkit, which implements ergonomic
	analysis methods, already available in literature or company practice,
	into digital tools for ergonomics, integrated into state-of-the-art
	virtual manufacturing software. These ergonomic tools are: the Posture
	Definition and Recognition and the Stress Screening. The former provides
	the functionality of defining and automatically recognising digital
	human postures, while the latter objectively evaluates ergonomically
	any unfavourable situations in a manual work process. It is shown
	that they are viable tools in detecting ergonomic problems, early
	in a development process, prior to physical installation. The benefits
	of the tools with the existing industrial practice are discussed.
	This article also describes technical implementation issues along
	with the application of the tools in an automotive case study. Â©

  abstract = {Distributed software development is a fact of life for many projects.
	It is well established that distance makes difficult to interact
	and to cooperate effectively. Scrum emphasizes communication, reduces
	coordination and control overhead; therefore it has enormous potential
	to help the management of distributed projects and has been increasingly
	used. Successfully managing the combined use of DSD and Scrum is
	a complex task and it requires carefully planning. Despite the importance
	and complexity of this type of problem, there seems to be a lack
	of reports, in the literature, of models that could support project
	managers dealing with these decision contexts. This paper presents
	a multi-criteria decision model for planning and finetuning such
	project plans. This model was developed using cognitive mapping and
	MACBETH (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation
	Technique). The application of the model is demonstrated, followed
	by conclusion and remarks about future work. Â© 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Software project tracking and project plan adjustment are two important
	software engineering activities. The class growth shows the design
	evolution of the software. The System Design Instability (SDI) metric
	indicates the progress of an object-oriented (OO) project once the
	project is set in motion. The SDI metric provides information on
	project evolution to project managers for possible adjustment to
	the project plan. The objectives of this paper are to test if the
	System Design Instability metric can be used to estimate and re-plan
	software projects in an XP-like agile process and study system design
	evolution in the Agile software process. We present an empirical
	study of the class growth and the SDI metric in two OO systems, developed
	using an agile process similar to Extreme Programming (XP). We analyzed
	the system evolutionary data collected on a daily basis from the
	two systems. We concluded that: the systems' class growth follows
	observable trends, the SDI metric can indicate project progress with
	certain trends, and the SDI metric is correlated with XP activities.
	In both of the analyzed systems, we observed two consistent jumps
	in the SDI metric values in early and late development phases. Part
	of the results agrees with a previous empirical study in another

	metrics in different contexts. In this paper, we present an empirical
	study of OO metrics in two iterative processes: the short-cycled
	agile process and the long-cycled framework evolution process. We
	find that OO metrics are effective in predicting design efforts and
	source lines of code added, changed, and deleted in the short-cycled
	agile process and ineffective in predicting the same aspects in the
	long-cycled framework process. This leads us to believe that OO metrics'
	predictive capability is limited to the design and implementation
	changes during the development iterations, not the long-term evolution
	of an established system in different releases.},

  abstract = {The executive concern of this paper is how to control and synchronize
	the flow of materials in Kanban controlled serial production line
	so as to build a dynamic material- flow system that successfully
	meets customer demand Just-In-Time. The proposed approach should
	yield a consistent integrated control policy with a feasible level
	of Work- In-Process and a feasible corresponding operational cost.
	The production line is described as queuing network, and then a Dynamic
	Programming (DP) algorithm is used to solve the network by decomposing
	it into several numbers of single- stage sub-production lines. Backward
	computations of DP are done recursively with synchronization mechanism,
	in the since that the solution of one sub-production line is used
	as an input to the previous one. A performance measure is then developed
	to determine and to compare the values of production parameters.
	Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the computations of different
	system parameters, the results are validated by discrete events simulation
	using ProModel software version 6.0, the performance measure coincided
	with the results of the model with very small error (0.044). As a
	result the number of Kanbans that are needed to deliver the batches
	from upstream stage to the downstream stage is determined in such
	a way that keeps the stages synchronized with the external customer
	demand. Â© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.},

  abstract = {As web based-applications become increasingly important to all aspects
	of life, there is a need to encourage practitioners to adopt best
	practices so as to improve the quality of the processes in use, and
	therefore achieve targets related to time, budget and quality. The
	web development industry worldwide is dominated by a myriad of small
	firms. This presents a challenge in terms of determining the current
	practices of industry participants, and in devising improvement initiatives
	which are feasible for small firms. The objectives of this research
	is to propose a software process model framework that assists the
	small firms in designing web based-applications so as not to run
	over budget and time. To achieve these objectives, an extensive literature
	survey of web development methodologies and software process improvement
	in small firms were conducted to identify web engineering practice
	in web development. The literature survey clarified that, there were
	several development methodologies of web-based application. These
	studies have not taken into consideration software process improvements.
	A software process framework for internet development in small firms
	is proposed in this research. This framework contains several steps
	to follow; the first step is to begin with small web project. The
	second steps is adopt the modified XP process model which is also
	a suggested process model for internet development in small firms,
	and then apply XXPM as a quality model for software process improvement.
	If the proposed software process framework is to be successful then
	it must be laid on web engineering practices. Â© 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Agile practitioners pride themselves on highly productive, responsive,
	low ceremony, lightweight, tacit knowledge processes with little
	waste, adaptive planning and frequent iterative delivery of value.
	It is often assumed that CMMI compliant processes need to be heavyweight,
	bureaucratic, slow moving, high ceremony and plan driven. Agile developers
	often skeptically perceive formal process improvement initiatives
	as management generated inefficiency that gets in the way of productivity.
	At Microsoft, we've adopted the teachings of W. Edwards Deming and
	stretched our MSF for Agile Software Development method to fit the
	requirements for CMMI Level 3. The resultant MSF for CMMI Process
	Improvement is a highly iterative, adaptive planning method, light
	on documentation, and heavily automated through tooling. It enables
	management and organization of software engineering through use of
	agile metrics such as velocity and cumulative flow but with an added
	dimension of an understanding of variation - adapted from Deming's
	teachings. This is the story of how mixing Deming with Agile produced
	a lightweight CMMI solution for .Net developers everywhere. © 2005

	the team is widely distributed around the world. We cover both narrative
	observations and quantitative measurements of Jazz usage. We demonstrate
	an objective measure of the value of such a software development

	can replace ad hoc communication. While Jazz provides sufficient

	Despite this starting observation, there are many reasons leading

	such tools could be useful for process and product data collection
	and analysis or for supporting distributed development. In this article,

	for managing XP projects and XP4IDE, a plug-in for integrating XPSwiki

	pointing and clicking because most LAN switches and routers that
	come with virtual LAN facilities require virtual workgroups to be
	set up and administered manually from a management console. To help
	prevent this problem, Agile Networks Inc (Concord, MA) has developed
	the ATMizer 125 Relational Switch by automatically allocating users
	to virtual LANs based on two criteria: network protocol and subnet
	address. The Ethernet/ATM switch owes its virtual LAN edge to a unique
	design that combines the self-learning abilities of a MAC-layer bridge
	with a router's ability to read protocols. This combination enables
	the ATMizer 125 to inspect network traffic and automatically group
	those workstations using the same protocol and having the same subnetwork
	address into the same virtual LAN. As network nodes are moved, added,
	or changed, the Agile switch reassigns them to the appropriate virtual
	LAN.},

	an important maintenance-planning tool. (BAR also has a mainframe
	computer with 26 remote terminals; 13 PCs are connected to the mainframe
	so data can be downloaded. BAR has 36 PCs, 30 of which are located
	in the headquarters building and linked by a local area network.
	The PCs are not exotic. The chief engineer's system is a 386, 16-mhz
	speed, 40MB hard disk with four megabytes of expanded memory. It
	includes a VGA monitor, clone Acer 1100 model, used with DOS 3.3,
	Lotus 2.2, HG 2.3 and Honeywell database software known as Total
	Information Management. This hardware package can be replaced today
	for less than $2,800. To entice employees to become computer literate

	incentive program through which the railroad paid a percentage of
	the purchase price of a PC system and financed the rest through payroll
	deduction without interest. Another element in the formula for successful
	m/w planning through the use of PCs is having an accurate and comprehensible

	goal of decreasing the entrance barrier for projects and domain experts
	to collaborate using semantic technologies. In the spirit of the

	performance in order to better understanding and simulating his reasoning
	in the software. The benefit is twofold: the measurement is objective
	and the closer simulation of human reasoning yields better performance
	in case of unexpected input. Although the area of application is
	the very broad intersection of medicine and technology, we focus
	on the automatic ECG interpretation, and propose the agile software
	featuring a human-like behavior. Two examples of experiments aimed

  abstract = {In today's dynamic market environments, producing high quality software
	rapidly and efficiently is crucial. In order to allow fast and reliable
	development processes, several agile methodologies have been designed
	and are now quite popular. Although existing agile methodologies
	are abundant, companies are increasingly interested in the construction
	of their own customized methods to fit their specific environment.
	In this paper, we investigate how agile methods can be constructed
	in-house to address specific software process needs. First, we examine
	a case study focusing on the tailoring of two agile methodologies,
	XP and Scrum. Then, we focus on the high-level scope of any agile
	method customization and investigate an approach based on the Situational
	Method Engineering (SME) paradigm that includes measurement concepts
	for constructing context specific agile methodologies. We also examine
	several existing metamodels proposed for use in SME. Finally, we
	introduce an agile metamodel designed to support the construction
	of agile methods and relying on measurements to provide guidance
	to agile methodologists during the construction phase and throughout
	the development process itself. Â© 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Reliable, automated detection and diagnosis of abnormal behavior within
	vapor compression refrigeration cycle (VCRC) equipment is extremely
	desirable for equipment owners and operators. The specific type of
	VCRC equipment studied in this paper is a 70-ton helical rotary,
	air-cooled chiller. The fault detection and diagnostic (FDD) tool
	developed as part of this research analyzes chiller operating data
	and detects faults through recognizing trends or patterns existing
	within the data [1]. The FDD method incorporates a neural network
	(NN) classifier to infer the current state given a vector of observables.
	Therefore the FDD method relies upon the availability of normal and
	fault empirical data for training purposes and therefore a fault
	library of empirical data is assembled [2]. This paper presents procedures
	for conducting sophisticated fault experiments on chillers that simulate
	air-cooled condenser, refrigerant, and oil related faults. The experimental
	processes described here are not well documented in literature and
	therefore will provide the interested reader with a useful guide.
	In addition, the authors provide evidence, based on both thermodynamics
	and empirical data analysis, that chiller performance is significantly
	degraded during fault operation. The chiller's performance degradation
	is successfully detected and classified by the NN FDD classifier
	as discussed in the paper's final section.},

	obeys "API usage rules" that specify what it means to be a good client
	of an API. The SLAM toolkit statically analyzes a C program to determine
	whether or not it violates given usage rules. The toolkit has two
	unique aspects: It does not require the programmer to annotate the
	source program (invariants are inferred); it minimizes noise (false
	error messages) through a process known as "counterexample-driven
	refinement". SLAM exploits and extends results from program analysis,
	model checking and automated deduction. We have successfully applied
	the SLAM toolkit to Windows XP device drivers, to both validate behavior
	and find defects in their usage of kernel APIs.},

  abstract = {Measuring the benefits of in-service inspection (ISI) is not easy.
	There appears to be two basic stand points. The first sees ISI as
	a true risk reducer, which can be used to ensure the safety of a
	component against failure. This view then leads naturally to a Risk
	Based In-Service Inspection (RBISI) philosophy. The second does not
	see the prime importance of ISI as a risk reducer but more as a confidence
	builder, providing some form of `defence in depth' behind an already
	established safety case. This tends to lean to an ISI philosophy
	based more on random sample inspections so as to reveal the `unexpected',
	or what has sometimes been called `Factor X'! This paper does not
	attempt to provide an answer to these two different views. Instead
	it tries to tread a mid-way path between them, looking to see if
	the two can be reconciled. This is done via a series of hypothetical
	examples evaluated using the probabilistic fracture mechanics program
	RR-PRODIGAL and a Bayesian updating process to assess confidence.},

	performed on a production 1.4 liter CNG (compressed natural gas)
	engine fueled with methane-hydrogen blends. The engine features a
	pent-roof combustion chamber, four valves per cylinder and a centrally
	located spark plug. The experimental tests have been carried out
	in order to quantify the cycle-to-cycle and the cylinder-to-cylinder
	combustion variation. Therefore, the engine has been equipped with
	four dedicated piezoelectric pressure transducers placed on each
	cylinder and located by the spark plug. At each test point, in-cylinder
	pressure, fuel consumption, induced air mass flow rate, pressure
	and temperature at different locations on the engine intake and exhaust
	systems as well as 'engine-out' pollutant emissions have been measured.
	The signals correlated to the engine operation have been acquired
	by means of a National Instruments PXI-DAQ system and a home developed
	software. The acquired data have then been processed through a combustion
	diagnostic tool resulting from the integration of an original multizone
	thermodynamic model with a CAD procedure for the evaluation of the
	burned-gas front geometry. The diagnostic tool allows the burning
	velocities to be computed. The tests have been performed over a wide
	range of engine speeds, loads and relative air-fuel ratios (up to
	the lean operation). For stoichiometric operation, the addition of
	hydrogen to CNG has produced a bsfc reduction ranging between 2 to
	7% and a bsTHC decrease up to the 40%. These benefits have appeared
	to be even higher for lean mixtures. Moreover, hydrogen has shown
	to significantly enhance the combustion process, thus leading to
	a sensibly lower cycle-to-cycle variability. As a matter of fact,
	hydrogen addition has generally resulted into extended operation
	up to RAFR = 1.8. Still, a discrepancy in the abovementioned conclusions
	was observed depending on the engine cylinder considered. Copyright

	degree focusing on software management and more broadly on the business
	of software than by a typical MBA. Our software management master's
	program integrates business, technical, and soft skills to prepare
	our students for technical leadership in their current companies
	or in entrepreneurial ventures. Our initial program built on the
	strengths of Carnegie Mellon's world-class software engineering education.
	We targeted students working in large companies, engaged in large-scale
	enterprise software projects, employing "high ceremony" software
	development processes. However, the majority of our students came
	from Silicon Valley companies which shared a product development
	focus, engaged in smaller projects, favored agile development processes,
	and measured development cycles in weeks rather than years. Our program
	has evolved to align with these interests. It employs a unique team-based
	and project-based pedagogy which emphasizes practical skills over
	theory, depth over breadth, and coaching over lecturing. High student
	satisfaction and growing enrollment have validated our curriculum
	decisions and have led us to make this program the educational centerpiece
	of Carnegie Mellon's Silicon Valley campus. Â© 2010 IEEE.},

	process, 2) measurement-based lessons learned about the maintenance
	process in the FDD, 3) a set of lessons learned about the establishment

	controllability even in slippery ground, and a roll cage protects
	the vehicle components from damage in case of a collision. The control
	system relies primarily on a differential GPS (Starfire) and a set
	of inertial sensors for navigating between the given set of waypoints.
	A sensor suite using infrared laser (LIDAR) and ultrasound sensing
	provides the capability of obstacle avoidance and path following.

	need to be tested, monitored and maintained: thus, the management

	available to guide developers and managers in making choices. Moreover,
	in order to make informed decisions, developers require access to
	real data that compares the different models and the results associated
	with the adoption of each model. An experiment in which 15 software
	teams developed comparable software products, using four different
	development approaches (V-model, incremental model, evolutionary
	model, and extreme programming), is described. Extensive measurements
	were taken to assess the time, quality, size, and development efficiency
	of each product. The experimental data collected and the conclusions
	related to the choice of method, its impact on the project and the
	quality of the results, are presented.},

	Service Pack 2 of Windows XP. TCP port 22 is used by the Secure Shell
	service. A service designed for security is listed in out set of
	ports to watch carefully and this service is a great target for attackers.
	If a proxy is not configured correctly, it will allow anyone on the

	have changed this fundamental aspect of Personal Information Management

	(a) The Windows Study-a longitudinal comparison of Google Desktop
	and Windows XP Search Companion, and (b) The Mac Study-a large scale
	comparison of Mac Spotlight and Sherlock. There were few effects
	for improved search. First, regardless of search engine, there was
	a strong navigation preference: on average, users estimated that
	they used navigation for 56 - 68% of file retrieval events but searched
	for only 4 - 15% of events. Second, the effect of improving the quality
	of the search engine on search usage was limited and inconsistent.
	Third, search was used mainly as a last resort when users could not
	remember file location. Finally, there was no evidence that using
	improved desktop search engines leads people to change their filing
	habits to become less reliant on hierarchical file organization.
	We conclude by offering theoretical explanations for navigation preference,
	relating to differences between PIM and Internet retrieval, and suggest
	alternative design directions for PIM systems. Â© 2008 ACM.},

  abstract = {The presence of solids flow maldistributions is a common occurrence
	in lean phase pneumatic conveying. As the gas and particles change
	direction in an elbow, the particles stratify into a narrow localized
	stream, forming what is referred to as a particle rope. The presence
	of roping can cause operating and maintenance problems, including
	pipe erosion, difficulties in measuring solids flow rate and difficulties
	in controlling the flow distributions in complex piping networks.
	This paper describes the application of computational fluid dynamics
	(CFD) software to develop and design flow mixing devices for pneumatic
	conveying applications. A combined numerical and experimental study
	was conducted to investigate mixing with devices installed immediately
	downstream of a 90 degree pipe bend. Coal particles with a mean diameter
	of 59 μm were transported with air in a pipeline which has a vertical
	run of 3.4 m and an inside diameter of 0.154 m. Numerical simulations
	were carried out using the CFX-4.2 code developed by AEA Technology.
	Particle motions were modeled using the Lagrangian tracking scheme.
	In order to verify these results, a reflective fiber optic probe
	was employed to measure local particle velocities and concentrations.
	The comparison of predicted and measured particle velocities and
	concentrations showed that CFD simulations gave good agreement with
	the measurements.},

	and selecting a right set of steps and measurements. Often, a process
	model or a specific methodology is used for this purpose, e.g. the
	V-Modell, RUP, or agile process methodologies. Each such model or
	methodology consists of certain activities, procedures, or methods,
	i.e. a set of process fragments. Debates usually focus on the choice
	among these models or methodologies as a whole, but not on the specific,
	quantitative contributions of the distinct process fragments with
	respect to the particular goals of the organization. Such a simplification
	misses important chances for adaptation and motivation in diversified
	system development environments. Therefore, a conceptual framework
	and tool set is presented in this paper to search for sets of process
	fragments, which are able to meet actual objectives in an optimal

	SSAB Oxelosund AB (Weldox 700 and 960). It is shown that modest heating
	(below 600°C) for a short period (less than 10 min) did not affect
	either the impact toughness or the fatigue strength. Workpieces substantially
	deformed (greater than 5%) and then straightened often have a lower
	fatigue strength than the original fatigue strength of the material.
	It is recommended that the temperature is continuously measured with
	thermoelements. The geometry (straightness) after straightening can
	have a significant effect on fatigue life. Gas heating or induction
	heating are recommended. The surface smoothness can be slightly improved
	by glass peening with an intensity of 0.10 Almen A, which also increases
	the fatigue life, sometimes by a factor 10 or more. The particular
	case of hot straightening of front axles for reducing tyre wear on
	trucks is discussed. A PC program has been established to simplify

	ways to manage the long-term effects of shortterm expedients. The
	technical debt metaphor is gaining significant traction in the agile
	development community as a way to understand and communicate such
	issues. The idea is that developers sometimes accept compromises
	in a system in one dimension (e.g., modularity) to meet an urgent
	demand in some other dimension (e.g., a deadline), and that such
	compromises incur a "debt": on which "interest" has to be paid and
	which the "principal" should be repaid at some point for the long-term
	health of the project. We argue that the software engineering research
	community has an opportunity to study and improve this concept. We
	can offer software engineers a foundation for managing such trade-offs

	of precisely positioned holes. To fixture a part, one places pins
	in some of the holes so that when the vise is closed, the part is
	reliably located and completely constrained. The modular vise concept
	can be adapted easily to the design of modular parallel-jaw grippers
	for robots. By attaching a grid-plate to each jaw of a parallel-jaw
	gripper, we gain the ability to easily construct high-quality grasps
	for a wide variety of parts from a standard set of hardware. Wallack
	and Canny developed an algorithm for planning planar grasp con figurations
	for the modular vise. In this paper, we expand this work to produce
	a 3-d fixture/gripper design tool. We describe several analyses we
	have added to the planar algorithm, including a 3-d grasp quality
	metric based on force information, 3-d geometric loading analysis,
	and inter-gripper interference analysis. Finally, we describe two
	applications of our code. One of these is an internal application
	at Sandia, while the other shows a potential use of our code for

	and tuning of Monte Carlo event generators. As well as the core Rivet
	library, this manual describes the usage of the rivet program and
	the AGILe generator interface library. The depth and level of description
	is chosen for users of the system, starting with the basics of using
	validation code written by others, and then covering sufficient details
	to write new Rivet analyses and calculational components. Program

	Boost (http://www.boostsoftware.com/),. YAML (http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).
	Nature of problem:. Experimental measurements from high-energy particle
	colliders should be defined and stored in a general framework such
	that it is simple to compare theory predictions to them. Rivet is
	such a framework, and contains at the same time a large collection
	of existing measurements. Solution method:. Rivet is based on HepMC
	events, a standardised output format provided by many theory simulation
	tools. Events are processed by Rivet to generate histograms for the
	requested list of analyses, incorporating all experimental phase
	space cuts and histogram definitions. Restrictions:. Cannot calculate
	statistical errors for correlated events as they appear in NLO calculations.
	Unusual features:. It is possible for the user to implement and use
	their own custom analysis as a module without having to modify the
	main Rivet code/installation. Running time:. Depends on the number
	and complexity of analyses being applied, but typically a few hundred
	events per second. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {A high-resolution Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner prototype,
	named Clear-PEM, was developed by the Portuguese PET Consortium in
	the framework of the Crystal Clear Collaboration (CCC). This scanner
	is a PET prototype dedicated for breast cancer imaging mammography,
	based on a novel readout scheme constituted by fine-pitch scintillator
	crystals, avalanche photodiodes (APD), low-noise high-gain frontend
	amplifiers and a reconfigurable FPGA-based electronics readout system.
	The Clear-PEM scanner is designed to exam both the breast and the
	auxiliary lymph node areas, aiming at the detection of tumours down
	to 2 mm in diameter. The prototype has two planar detector heads,
	each composed of 96 detector modules. Each detector module is composed
	of a matrix of 32 identical 2x2x20 mm3 LYSO:Ce scintillator crystals,
	read at both ends by Hamamatsu S8550 APD arrays (4x8) for Depth-of-Interaction
	(DOI) capability. The APD arrays were characterized through the measurement
	of gain and dark current as a function of bias voltage, under controlled
	conditions. A set of 984 APD arrays followed a well defined quality
	control (QC) protocol, aiming at the rejection of arrays not complying
	with the defined specifications. From the total of 984, only 1 (0.1%)
	was rejected, reassuring the trust in these detectors for prototype
	assembly and future applications.},

	It is said to have many advantages over traditional approaches, such
	as reuse or quality improvement, also for embedded systems. Along
	a similar line of argumentation, component-based software engineering
	is advocated. In order to investigate these claims, the MARMOT method
	was applied to develop several variants of a small micro-controller-based
	automotive subsystem. Several key figures, like model size and development
	effort were measured and compared with figures coming from two mainstream
	methods: the Unified Process and Agile Development. The analysis
	reveals that model-driven, component-oriented development performs
	well and leads to maintainable systems and a higher-than-normal reuse

  abstract = {Fully automated, touchless fab production would not be possible without
	the new generation of factory control software designed to run factories
	without direct human intervention. These systems work especially
	well when running large volumes of fully qualified products on fully
	qualified tools. However, a great deal of planning and creativity
	is required to setup and maintain these systems to make them adaptable
	for new product/process qualification and ramp, new tool qualification,
	tool/process monitoring, sharing of production and development tools,
	and many other activities driven by shortening product life cycles
	and other aspects of the modern semiconductor industry. Responsibility
	for ensuring that the fab can be powerful, agile, and flexible lies
	across many internal organizations. But the responsibility lies most
	directly with the product integration/route build team and the factory
	systems integrators/lead users. The product integration/route build
	teams are responsible for defining all factory entities that will
	be controlled or need to be monitored for fab control. The factory
	systems integrators/lead users must then configure their systems
	run the fab within this environment fully defined by the product
	integration/route build teams. This article will explain how the
	fab "model" cannot be too simple or generic to allow the factory
	systems to properly monitor the fab and take appropriate and timely
	action for efficient production. Conversely the fab "model" cannot
	be so complex that defining product/process changes becomes so labor
	intensive and risk laden that it becomes the major cycle time contributor
	to new product/process introduction. These issues will be explained
	from the perspective of the dispatching system which uses a large
	spectrum of fab data to decide how the fab is run. The solutions
	that these teams use to solve the problems above have a direct effect
	on the ability of the fab to meet the needs of the business.},

	principles leads to the delivery of high quality code in evolutionary
	increments. Confidence in resulting systems is mostly gained through
	the use of unit test suites, entrusted to catch regressions as soon
	as they occur. Consequently, the system can only be as trustworthy
	as its tests, meaning that measurements of the testsE quality is
	crucial. Whilst mutation testing has been proposed as a means of
	uncovering test suite defects, it has not been widely adopted in
	the industry; mainly due to its computational expense and manual
	effort required by developers investigating unkilled mutants. To
	make mutation testing affordable, we propose incremental mutation
	testing - a variation of mutation testing which leverages the iterative
	nature of agile development by limiting the scope of mutant generation
	to sections of code which have changed since the last mutation run.
	Preliminary results show that the number of mutants generated is
	drastically reduced along with the time required to generate mutants
	and execute tests against them. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

	stories known as scenarios. These scenarios capture a subset of the
	program's functionality and often permit developers to perform an
	ad hoc form of program slicing. We developed a tool, and integrated
	it into Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, to formalise the slicing of
	a program based on a specified scenario. During development, programmers
	are required to insert, using a predefined macro, an XML tag set
	before all methods and class variables that they add, edit, or reference.
	Our slicing tool uses these tags to identify the methods and variables
	associated with a specific scenario and to create a compilable program
	slice that implements only the scenario. Scenario-based slices can
	be used by both developers and managers in support of tasks that
	include, but are not limited to, debugging, metric generation (e.g.,
	complexity), cost estimation, prioritization, and requirements tracing.

  abstract = {An axial-swirl, lean premixed fuel injector typical of stationary
	gas turbine combustors has been analyzed using Large Eddy Simulation
	(LES). The objective of the study was to evaluate the LES modeling
	approach for predicting emissions of CO and NOX at practical engine
	conditions (P=13.6 atm, Tin=734 K = 861°F) and over a range of natural
	gas-air equivalence ratios (0.42 to 0.58). Experimental data from
	a recent UTRC/ DOE-NETL program was used to evaluate the model. The
	experimental tests found NOx emissions decreased significantly with
	a decrease in equivalence ratio while CO emissions decreased initially,
	but then increased at the leanest conditions. LES calculations were
	performed using a parallel (domain decomposition), pressure-based,
	unstructured-grid flow solver within the CFD-ACE+ commercial software.
	The LES software solves the general transport equations for mass,
	momentum, energy, and chemical species without assumption at the
	grid-and time-resolved scales of the flow, and models the turbulent
	mixing and chemistry below the locally resolved grid/time-scales.
	The Localized Dynamic subgrid Kinetic energy Model (LDKM) was used
	to model the unresolved turbulence and a 2-step assumed PDF method,
	with decoupled NOX, was used to model the unresolved turbulence-chemistry
	interactions. Parallel calculations on a cluster of 22 Linux-based
	PCs were carried out. It was shown that LES was able to accurately
	predict the CO and NOX at an equivalence ratio of 0.58, and at leaner
	equivalence ratios the model was able to give qualitative agreement
	with the measurements. Some inadequacies in the NOX chemistry at
	ultra lean conditions and the near-wall flow boundaries were observed.},

	in popularity over the past decade. Researchers and practitioners
	alike have argued that numerous benefits could be garnered from adopting
	a feature-driven development approach. However, those persuasive
	arguments have not been matched with supporting empirical evidence.
	Moreover, developing software systems around features involves new
	technical and organizational elements that could have significant
	implications for outcomes such as software quality. This paper presents
	an empirical analysis of a large-scale project that implemented 1195
	features in a software system. We examined the impact that technical
	attributes of product features, attributes of the feature teams and
	crossfeature interactions have on software integration failures.
	Our results show that technical factors such as the nature of component
	dependencies and organizational factors such as the geographic dispersion
	of the feature teams and the role of the feature owners had complementary
	impact suggesting their independent and important role in terms of
	software quality. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that cross-feature
	interactions, measured as the number of architectural dependencies
	between two product features, are a major driver of integration failures.
	The research and practical implications of our results are discussed.

	uses an optimized COW (Copy-on-Write) virtual block device to split
	the traditional one-piece large-sized VD image into multiple small-sized
	SVDs (Software Virtual Disk) at a basic granularity of a single kind
	of software. Based on the finegrained VD splitting, DPM uses an access
	frequency and priority-based prefetch target identifying-APTI algorithm
	to identify the SVDs of the being-used software by the user in real-time
	mode at destination site, and prefetches those SVDs by utilizing
	P2P transportation mechanism at background. We have built a prototype
	to realize DPM on Xen virtual machine monitor (VMM). Experiments
	on the prototype show that DPM can effectively improve the VM performance
	at an unexpected destination site without any cached VD state, supporting
	agile mobility of personal computing environments. Â© 2009 IEEE.},

	and execution-monitoring. Limited by the undecidability of malicious
	codes, they can't defend against unknown attacks effectively. This
	paper investigates an integrity measurement and access control combined
	program security inspection model. On initial system setup, it indexes
	all known and trusted programs by both the identifiers and the integrity
	signatures of them in a white list (WL). During system running time,
	it measures integrity signature of each program file to be loaded
	and verifies it with WL. By disallowing unknown or unexpectedly modified
	programs from running, the model guarantees that only trusted programs
	can be invoked. Not relying on signatures of malicious codes, it
	is not limited by their undecidability and therefore is able to combat
	both known and unknown attacks with no false results. The model is
	implemented in Windows 2000/XP with neither source code nor binary
	level modifications to the Windows OS is required by using the technology
	of kernel mode file system filter driver. To improve the usability
	of the implementation, an administrative utility is created to censor
	new programs which came after the initial system setup. Those from
	trusted origins and not altered after release are thought to be secure
	and are added to WL for them to work normally. Â© 2008 IEEE.},

	running unmodified applications and operating systems, (iv) provide
	visibility with minimal simulation performance impact and (v) are
	capable of running current instruction sets such as x86. It achieves
	its capabilities by partitioning simulators into a speculative functional
	model component that simulates the instruction set architecture and
	a timing model component that predicts performance. The speculative
	functional model enables the simulator to be parallelized, implementing
	the timing model in FPGA hardware for speed and the functional model
	using a modified full-system simulators. We currently achieve an
	average simulation speed of 1.2MIPS running x86 applications on x86
	Linux and Windows XP and expect to achieve 10MIPS over time. Such
	simulators are useful to virtually all computer system simulator
	users ranging from architects, through RTL designers and verifiers
	to software developers. Sharing a common simulation/design infrastructure
	could foster better communication between these groups, potentially

  abstract = {This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of
	a parallel indexer called PAMIS for a polygonal 2D shape image database.
	PAMIS is based on a shape representation scheme called the turning
	function, which exhibits the desirable properties of position-, scale-,
	and rotation-invariance, and has a similarity metric function that
	satisfies the triangular inequality, which is required for efficient
	database indexing. Because the goal of the PAMIS project is to support
	`like-this' image queries, the indexing scheme we chose, the vantage-point
	tree (VPT), uses relative rather than absolute distance values to
	organize the database elements for efficient nearest-neighbor search.
	We have successfully implemented PAMIS on a network of workstations
	to exploit the I/O and computation parallelism inherent in the VPT
	algorithm. We found that it is preferable to make the VPT node size
	as small as possible in order to have a lean and deep VPT structure,
	and the best-case scheduling strategy performs the best among the
	scheduling strategies considered. Overall, the performance of the
	VPT algorithm scales very well with the number of processors, and
	the indexing efficiency, defined as the percentage of database elements
	touched by the search, of PAMIS is 6% and 39% for `good' queries
	that ask for 1 and 50 nearest neighbors, respectively.},

	and to monitor exceptions or errors of a software system in order
	to test security of it. API fuzz testing without considering the
	dependency between functions generates many errors, because required
	functions aren't called before the target function is called. Therefore,
	unexpected data cannot reach various codes in the target function.
	We define the dependency as relation of functions that must be called
	before the target function is called. In order to solve the problem
	of the dependency during performing API fuzz testing, we propose
	a novel methodology that analyzes the dependency between functions
	automatically and that performs API fuzz testing with considering
	the dependency, and implement a practical tool for our methodology.
	We name the methodology the Call-Flow Aware API Fuzz Testing(CFAFT).
	Call-Flow is the order that functions with the dependency are called.
	By considering Call-Flow of functions, CFAFT can perform API fuzz
	testing without errors related to the dependency and insert invalid
	data into various codes in functions. We experimented on DLL files
	in the system folder of Windows XP SP2. Experimental result showed
	that CFAFT removed errors related to the dependency between functions.

  abstract = {A FORTRAN 77 program for calculating energy values, reaction matrix
	and corresponding radial wave functions in a coupled-channel approximation
	of the hyperspherical adiabatic approach is presented. In this approach,
	a multi-dimensional SchrÃ¶dinger equation is reduced to a system
	of the coupled second-order ordinary differential equations on a
	finite interval with homogeneous boundary conditions: (i) the Dirichlet,
	Neumann and third type at the left and right boundary points for
	continuous spectrum problem, (ii) the Dirichlet and Neumann type
	conditions at left boundary point and Dirichlet, Neumann and third
	type at the right boundary point for the discrete spectrum problem.
	The resulting system of radial equations containing the potential
	matrix elements and first-derivative coupling terms is solved using
	high-order accuracy approximations of the finite element method.
	As a test desk, the program is applied to the calculation of the
	reaction matrix and radial wave functions for 3D-model of a hydrogen-like
	atom in a homogeneous magnetic field. This version extends the previous
	version 1.0 of the KANTBP program [O. Chuluunbaatar, A.A. Gusev,

	IV Xeon, Opteron 248, Intel Pentium IV. Operating system: OC Linux,
	Unix AIX 5.3, SunOS 5.8, Solaris, Windows XP. RAM: This depends on1.the
	number of differential equations;2.the number and order of finite
	elements;3.the number of hyperradial points; and4.the number of eigensolutions
	required. The test run requires 2 MB. Classification: 2.1, 2.4. External
	routines: GAULEG and GAUSSJ [2]. Nature of problem: In the hyperspherical
	adiabatic approach [3-5], a multidimensional SchrÃ¶dinger equation
	for a two-electron system [6] or a hydrogen atom in magnetic field
	[7-9] is reduced by separating radial coordinate ?� from the angular
	variables to a system of the second-order ordinary differential equations
	containing the potential matrix elements and first-derivative coupling
	terms. The purpose of this paper is to present the finite element
	method procedure based on the use of high-order accuracy approximations
	for calculating approximate eigensolutions of the continuum spectrum
	for such systems of coupled differential equations on finite intervals
	of the radial variable ?� âˆˆ [?� min, ?� max]. This
	approach can be used in the calculations of effects of electron screening
	on low-energy fusion cross sections [10-12]. Solution method: The
	boundary problems for the coupled second-order differential equations
	are solved by the finite element method using high-order accuracy
	approximations [13]. The generalized algebraic eigenvalue problem
	AF = E BF with respect to pair unknowns (E, F) arising after the
	replacement of the differential problem by the finite-element approximation
	is solved by the subspace iteration method using the SSPACE program
	[14]. The generalized algebraic eigenvalue problem (A - E B) F =
	Î» DF with respect to pair unknowns (Î», F) arising after the
	corresponding replacement of the scattering boundary problem in open
	channels at fixed energy value, E, is solved by the LDL T factorization
	of symmetric matrix and back-substitution methods using the DECOMP
	and REDBAK programs, respectively [14]. As a test desk, the program
	is applied to the calculation of the reaction matrix and corresponding
	radial wave functions for 3D-model of a hydrogen-like atom in a homogeneous
	magnetic field described in [9] on finite intervals of the radial
	variable ?� âˆˆ [?� min, ?� max]. For this benchmark
	model the required analytical expressions for asymptotics of the
	potential matrix elements and first-derivative coupling terms, and
	also asymptotics of radial solutions of the boundary problems for
	coupled differential equations have been produced with help of a
	MAPLE computer algebra system. Restrictions: The computer memory
	requirements depend on:1.the number of differential equations;2.the
	number and order of finite elements;3.the total number of hyperradial
	points; and4.the number of eigensolutions required. Restrictions
	due to dimension sizes may be easily alleviated by altering PARAMETER
	statements (see Section 3 and [1] for details). The user must also
	supply subroutine POTCAL for evaluating potential matrix elements.
	The user should also supply subroutines ASYMEV (when solving the
	eigenvalue problem) or ASYMS0 and ASYMSC (when solving the scattering
	problem) which evaluate asymptotics of the radial wave functions
	at left and right boundary points in case of a boundary condition
	of the third type for the above problems. Running time: The running
	time depends critically upon:1.the number of differential equations;2.the
	number and order of finite elements;3.the total number of hyperradial
	points on interval [?� min, ?� max]; and4.the number of eigensolutions
	required. The test run which accompanies this paper took 2 s without
	calculation of matrix potentials on the Intel Pentium IV 2.4 GHz.

	radar transmitter concepts have emerged over the past decade. Such
	new capabilities have stimulated interest in exploiting agile transmitter
	capabilities. Although few demonstrations have been conducted on
	real radars or even test-bed systems, a significant corpus of theoretical
	and simulation results clearly indicates that waveform agility, if
	suitably applied, can yield highly substantial performance gains
	across different radar application scenarios. Most schemes introduced
	for exploiting waveform agility involve closed-loop waveform scheduling.
	Principled scheduling of waveforms in radar and other active sensing
	modalities is motivated by the nonexistence of any single waveform
	that is ideal for all situations encountered in typical operational
	scenarios. This then increases the possibility of achieving operationally
	significant performance gains through close-loop waveform scheduling.},

	developed with object-oriented technology and an agile process. During
	the development we systematically performed measurements on the source
	code, using software metrics that have been proved to be correlated
	with software quality, such as the Chidamber and Kemerer suite and
	Lines of Code metrics. We also computed metrics derived from the
	class dependency graph, including metrics derived from Social Network
	Analysis. The application development evolved through phases, characterized
	by a different level of adoption of some key agile practices - namely
	pair programming, test-based development and refactoring. The evolution
	of the metrics of the system, and their behavior related to the agile
	practices adoption level, is presented and discussed. We show that,
	in the reported case study, a few metrics are enough to characterize
	with high significance the various phases of the project. Consequently,
	software quality, as measured using these metrics, seems directly
	related to agile practices adoption. Â© 2012 World Scientific Publishing

	some key agile practices - such as pair programming, test-based development

	have become standard tools for collecting information on sensitive
	measures. However, while the method is commonly applied in the English
	language, its use is less prevalent in non-English language data
	collection efforts. One reason for the low occurrence of non-English
	audio-CASI applications is the relatively slow conversion of audio-CASI
	software to the nonstandard fonts required to display some languages
	(e.g., Russian, Chinese). Every written language requires an alphabet
	and a variety of fonts designed to display the special symbols and
	notations used by that language. However, early versions of PC operating
	systems were not flexible in their capacity to support nonstandard
	fonts. That is no longer the case with the development of more advanced
	operating systems such as Windows XP. This paper describes a versatile
	method for implementing audio-CASI technologies using any defined
	font and therefore any alphabet for which a font exists. This method
	relies on the capabilities of Rich Text Format for representing the
	visual or screen display component of the survey. Rich Text Format
	is supported by a variety of text editors and word processing packages,
	including Word and Word Perfect. It can be implemented in any software
	system with Rich Text Edit Control (RTEC). We describe a general
	process that exploits the capabilities of RTEC to efficiently implement
	multilingual audio-CASI applications, and demonstrate that process

	the "physical" activities that developers do. In this paper, we present
	DroidSense, a non-invasive tool that runs on Android-based mobile
	phones and collects data about developers involvement in Agile software
	development activities, e.g. Pair Programming, daily stand-ups, or
	planning game, by measuring their proximity to computers and also
	other developers. DroidSense collects data automatically via Bluetooth
	signal created by other phones, personal computers, and other devices.
	We explain detailed design and implementation of the tool. Eventually,

	an impediment? Previous experience with heavy weight processes produced
	anecdotal evidence that students perceived them as onerous and irrelevant.
	To determine student perceptions of the relevancy of agile principles,
	we conducted a year long study during senior student software development
	projects in which they applied agile principles working with industry
	clients under minimal supervision. Results indicate a strong relationship
	between student perception of value delivered to the client and their
	perception of the value of utilizing agile principles to achieve

  abstract = {Some recent commercial combine harvesters are equipped with a Controller
	Area Network (CAN) system. This is a serial communications protocol
	which efficiently supports distributed real-time control with a very
	high level of security [Bosch, R., 1991. CAN Specification Version
	2.0. Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart, 70 pp.]. A new software platform
	'CANbus Control Design Interface' was developed and evaluated for
	control design for combine automation. This tool offers new possibilities
	for experimental design and provides a real-time graphical interface
	for the control engineer. The software module permits the exchange
	of the desired sensor and actuator signals between the CANbus network
	and a measurement computer at a sample rate of 5 Hz. Several control
	design experiments have already been integrated in the CANbus Control
	Design Interface environment. The synergy between two programming
	languages, Visual C++Â® and MatlabÂ®, characterizes the developed
	software module. A standard Windows environment was used as the operating
	system. The timing of the different measurement and control tasks
	was performed by two timing protocols, the Windows and the Multimedia
	timer. This study addresses the question of whether a standard operating
	system like Windows can be used for control experiments within the
	combine automation framework. Experiments have shown that it is possible
	to use Windows as an operating system for soft real-time applications
	under certain conditions. The control environment of a combine harvester
	can be considered as a soft real-time environment because the occurrence
	of time jitter or the failure of an event will never lead to the
	failure of the whole control system. By making use of a standard
	Windows NT-XP environment, a robust and accurate 5 Hz timing performance
	was achieved. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	combustion application has been a challenging task due to difficulties
	in both modeling and experimental measurements. However, validation
	is considered to be an essential exercise for the success of CFD
	tools in the development of future combustion systems. This paper
	describes a benchmark spray combustion database collected at National
	Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and validation of a
	commercial CFD code using these data. Swirl-stabilized combustion
	of methanol at lean operating conditions in the NIST reference spray
	combustor facility was selected to be the baseline case for which
	both measurements and predictions were made. A comparison is presented
	of CFD predictions with experimental data for droplet size and velocity,
	and spray volume flux. The agreement between the CFD calculations
	and the experimental data is generally good once certain adjustments
	were made to the measured data close to the injector tip. The adjustments
	were made based on extrapolation from more accurate downstream measurements.
	Specification of droplet initial conditions for computational modeling
	that accurately reflect the laboratory conditions remains a significant
	issue that needs further improvement.},

  abstract = {A flexible tool for collection of data from imaging sensors is presented.
	It is compatible to Windows XP and later. It is designed to meet
	demanding requirements in scientific applications and has been evaluated
	both in laboratory measurements and extended field trials. Main features
	of the image capturing software, denoted D8, are: D8 supports various
	kinds of cameras: monospectral, multispectral and hyperspectral.
	A new camera is included by adding additional information in a configuration
	list. The image data acquired from D8 are standardized into formats
	based on the ENVI format. Each single image gets a timestamp with
	the precision of 1 ms. There is support for an FPGA board, which
	can improve the precision to 1 Î¼s. Through D8 an arbitrary number
	of cameras can be temporally synchronized and the data collected.
	This options imitates true multi-colour cameras. Results from a temporal
	synchronization and spatial alignment of two multiband cameras are
	presented. Â© 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for

  abstract = {Tool path generation is one of the most complex problems in Computer
	Aided Manufacturing. Although some efficient strategies have been
	developed, most of them are only useful for standard machining. The
	algorithm called Virtual Digitizing avoids this problem by its own
	definition but its computing cost is high and makes it difficult
	for being integrated in standard machining in order to adopt the
	new ISO standard 14649. Presented in the paper there is a Virtual
	Digitizing hardware/software architecture that takes advantage of
	Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to improve the algorithm efficiency
	and to meet the actual restrictions of the traditional Computer Numeric
	Control systems at the same time. In order to evaluate the architecture,
	a prototype was implemented using a commercial reconfigurable platform
	integrated within a CNC lathe for shoe last machining. The performance
	of the system for tool path generation was measured for different
	trajectory and surface precisions using a database of real shoe models.
	The experiments show a significant speedup for all the cases and
	maintaining the error of the results below the maximum allowed. Â©2007

	to the Integrated Family of Test Equipment (IFTE) developed and managed
	by Product Manager, Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (PM
	TMDE). This is Version 6 of what is commonly known as the Base Shop
	Test Facility series of systems developed by the Off Platform, Automatic
	Test System program. NGATS is a reconfigurable, general-purpose,
	mobile, deployable, automatic test system designed to provide sustainment
	support to all Army weapon systems. This flexible testing platform
	will finally standardize and reduce the quantity of the Army's ATE
	systems to one modern tester and improve weapon system availability.
	It will allow for a decrease in logistical support requirements for
	ATE systems and the supported weapons systems and increase the mobility,
	deployability, affordability and supportability, of automated test
	equipment. NGATS assures compliance with Joint NxTest architecture
	and will support the Agile Rapid Global Combat Support (ARGCS) Advanced
	Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) by using a common framework
	for DOD Automatic Test Systems (ATS). Incremental deployment of this
	system will ultimately modernize and replace three existing test
	platforms, DSESTS, BSTF (V) 3, and BSTF (V) 5. NGATS will not only
	support the weapons systems currently fielded but will also support
	additional weapons systems as they are developed and fielded in the
	future. The NGATS will initially take advantage of the existing Test
	Program Sets for legacy weapons systems however new systems and those
	legacy systems that will remain in the Army inventory will have TPSs
	designed to take full advantage of the modern NGATS technology. Increment
	1 replaces DSESTS and supports the weapons systems in the Heavy Brigade
	Combat Team (HBCT). The TPSs for Abrams, Bradley and other systems
	will be rehosted to NGATS with significant improvements. Increment
	2 replaces BSTF (V) 3 and supports the MLRS, Avenger, Paladin, TOW,
	SINCGARS, Kiowa Warrior, Ground Based Sensor, G/VLLD, and M1A1 (SRUs)
	systems. Increment 3 replaces BSTF (V) 5 and supports the Kiowa Warrior
	and Apache. There has been increased interest in utilizing the IFTE
	NGATS as an Army organic sustainment support platform. Other systems
	that are candidates for support are KNIGHT, LLDR, STRYKER, FCS, Firefinder,
	LOSAT, NLOS, HIMARS, Land Warrior, SHORADS, TAD, and CROWS. Â©

	design, whereas architecture of a software system is typically defined
	as the fundamental organization of the system embodied in its components,
	their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles
	governing the system's design and evolution. Obviously, as long as
	there were no software systems, governing their architecture was
	no problem at all; when there were only small systems, governing
	their architecture became a mild problem; and now we have gigantic
	software systems, and governing their architecture has become an
	equally gigantic problem (to paraphrase Edsger Dijkstra). In this
	paper we propose a unified approach to the problem of governing (or
	managing) the knowledge about architecture of software systems and
	demonstrate by example its impact on a certain software project.
	First we postulate that only the holistic approach that supports
	continuous integration and verification for all system architectural
	artifacts is one worth taking. Next we demonstrate by example how

	generally available. However, it is generally difficult to compare

	to guide developers and managers in making choices. Moreover in order
	to make informed decisions developers require access to real data
	that compares the different models and the results associated with
	the adoption of each model. This paper describes an experiment in
	which fifteen software teams developed comparable software products
	using four different development approaches (V-model, incremental,
	evolutionary and Extreme Programming). Extensive measurements were
	taken to assess the time, quality, size, and development efficiency
	of each product. The paper presents the experimental data collected
	and the conclusions related to the choice of method, its impact on
	the project and the quality of the results as well as the general
	implications to the practice of systems engineering project management.

	High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) is a very useful technique
	for studying growth and surface analysis of thin epitaxial structures
	prepared by the Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). The RHEED technique
	can reveal, almost instantaneously, changes either in the coverage
	of the sample surface by adsorbates or in the surface structure of
	a thin film. Solution method: The calculations are based on the use
	of a dynamical diffraction theory in which the electrons are taken
	to be diffracted by a potential, which is periodic in the dimension
	perpendicular to the surface. Reasons for new version: Responding
	to the user feedback the graphical version of the RHEED program has
	been upgraded to C++0x language standards. Also, functionality and
	documentation of the program have been improved. Summary of revisions:
	1.Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) is the approach defined by the
	Object Management Group (OMG) for software development under the
	Model-Driven Engineering framework [1]. The MDA approach shifts the
	focus of software development from writing code to building models.
	By adapting a model-centric approach, the MDA approach hopes to automate
	the generation of system implementation artifacts directly from the
	model. The following three models are the core of the MDA: (i) the
	Computation Independent Model (CIM), which is focused on basic requirements
	of the system, (ii) the Platform Independent Model (PIM), which is
	used by software architects and designers, and is focused on the
	operational capabilities of a system outside the context of a specific
	platform, and (iii) the Platform Specific Model (PSM), which is used
	by software developers and programmers, and includes details relating
	to the system for a specific platform. Basic requirements for the
	calculation of the RHEED intensity rocking curves in the one-beam
	condition have been described in Ref. [2]. Fig. 1 shows the PIM for
	the present version of the program. Fig. 2 presents the PSM for the
	program.2.The TGraph2D.bpk package has been recompiled to Graph2D0x.bpl
	and upgraded according to C++0x language standards. Fig. 3 shows
	the PSM of the Graph2D component, which is manifested by the Graph2D0x.bpl
	package presently. This diagram is a graphic presentation of the
	static view, which shows a collection of declarative model elements
	and their relationships. Installation instructions of the Graph2D0x
	package can be found in the new distribution.3.The program requires
	the user to provide the appropriate parameters for the crystal structure
	under investigation. These parameters are loaded from the parameters.ini
	file at run-time. Instructions for the preparation of the .ini files
	can be found in the new distribution.4.The program enables carrying
	out one-dimensional dynamical calculations for the fcc lattice, with
	a two-atoms basis and fcc lattice, with one atom basis but yet the
	zeroth Fourier component of the scattering potential in the TRHEED1D::crystPotUg()
	function can be modified according to users' specific application
	requirements.5.A graphical user interface (GUI) for the program has
	been reconstructed.6.The program has been compiled with English/USA
	regional and language options. Unusual features: The program is distributed
	in the form of main projects RHEEDGr_09.cbproj and Graph2D0x.cbproj
	with associated files, and should be compiled using Code Gear C++
	Builder 2009 compilers. Running time: The typical running time is
	machine and user-parameters dependent. References: [1]OMG, Model

	Nature of physical problem: Reflection high-energy electron diffraction
	(RHEED) is a very useful technique for studying the growth and the
	surface analysis of thin epitaxial structures prepared by the molecular
	beam epitaxy (MBE). RHEED rocking curves recorded from heteroepitaxial
	layers are used for the non-destructive evaluation of epilayer thickness
	and composition with a high degree of accuracy. Rocking curves from
	such heterostructures are often very complex because the thickness
	fringes from every layer beat together. Simulations based on dynamical
	diffraction theory are generally used to interpret the rocking curves
	of such structures from which very small changes in thickness and
	composition can be obtained. Rocking curves are also used to determine
	the level of strain and its relaxation mechanism in a lattice-mismatched
	system. Method of solution: The new version of the program retains
	the design and structure of the previous one [A. Daniluk, Comput.
	Phys. Comm. 166 (2005) 123. [1]]. Reasons for the new version: Responding
	to the user feedback we presented an extension of the RHEED program
	that enables computing the crystalline potentials for epitaxial heterostructures
	and corresponding values of the amplitude of the RHEED intensity
	oscillations. Summary of revisions: (1)In this paper we show how
	the dynamical approach may be applied to creation of a practical
	computing algorithm to calculate of the intensity of the specularly
	reflected RHEED beam during MBE growth of Pb on Si(111). The structural
	properties of the Pb{single bond}Si interface have been{A figure
	is presented}[b]{A figure is presented}{A figure is presented} meticulously
	studied by Howes and co-workers [P.B. Howes, K.A. Edwards, D.J. Hughes,
	J.E. Macdonald, T. Hibma, T. Bootsma, M.A. James, Surf. Sci. Lett.
	331 (1995) 646; K.A. Edwards, P.B. Howes, J.E. Macdonald, T. Hibma,
	T. Bootsma, M.A. James, Surf. Sci. 424 (1999) 169. [2,3]], and Lucas
	and Loretto [C.A. Lucas, D. Loretto, Surf. Sci. Lett. 344 (1995)
	1219. [4]] (X-ray diffraction). The new version of the RHEED program
	has the same design as the previous one [A. Daniluk, Comput. Phys.
	Comm. 166 (2005) 123. [1]]. To simulate the structural variations
	of whole crystalline heterostructure along the surface normal direction
	the substrate and layers are divided into an assembly of n atomic
	layers. Each of these layers is further divided into an assembly
	of i thin slices parallel to the surface and each slice is assumed
	to have a constant potential normal to the surface as shown in Fig.
	1. The Fourier component of the scattering potential of the whole
	crystalline heterostructure can be determined as a sum of contributions
	coming from all thin slices of n individual atomic layers. To carry
	out one-dimensional calculations we used the self-consistent thicknessZi_Substrate(),
	thicknessZi_Layers(), thicknessZn_Substrate(), thicknessZn_Layers(),
	crystPotUgSubstrate() and crystPotUgLayers() functions. Fig. 2 presents
	the crystalline potentials (real part) calculated for some Pb layers
	on a Si(111) substrate at 70 K. Fig. 3 shows a dynamically calculated
	one-beam rocking curve for Pb/Si(111).{A figure is presented}{A figure
	is presented}(2)The presented algorithm is a generalization of the
	previous one. By attributing 0 to the numberOfLayers and NLayers
	constant parameters (Fig. 4) and removing appropriate functions from
	the main program (Fig. 5), we obtain the same results as in the case
	of monocrystal [A. Daniluk, Comput. Phys. Comm. 166 (2005) 123. [1]].
	Typical running time: The typical running time is machine and user-parameters
	dependent. Unusual features of the program: The program is presented
	in the form of a basic unit RHEED_v2.cpp. It is not tied to any specific
	hardware and systems software platform, and could be compiled using
	C++ compilers, including C++ Builder, VC++ and g++. Â© 2006 Elsevier

	its cost as well as the easiness of use, not being necessary specific
	knowledge of computer programming. The new version of the software
	Assistat-Statistical Assistance (version 7.3) has an easy installation
	program and runs in Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows XP and other
	operating systems from the Windows family. It makes variance analysis
	(ANOVA) for data from experiments with the following design: entirely
	randomized, randomized blocks, Latin square, split-plots, split-split-plots
	and factorial, applying jointly the test "F" to verify effect of
	significance and the test of Tukey or the test "t" to compare means.
	In the cases of experiments in split-plots, split-split-plots and
	factorial, it applies the crossed Tukey test in the interaction means,
	when there is significant interaction effect. It also makes regression
	in the variance analysis, in the case of quantitative treatments.
	It still performs adjustment test or adherence of series by the method
	of Kolmogorov-Smirnov, test of the correlation coefficient, test
	of Mann-Whitney, test of Kruskal-Wallis and the following normality
	tests: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, CramÃ©r-von Mises, Anderson-Darling,
	Kuiper, Watson, Lilliefors and Shapiro-Wilk. Together with the results
	of the normality tests it presents the main statistical measures
	as mean, standard deviation, curtose, asymmetry and other. The Assistat
	is rapidly running and friendly used software that caries out most
	of the necessities on data variance analysis of the agricultural
	engineering researchers.},

  abstract = {Contemporary middleware offers powerful abstractions to construct
	distributed software systems. However, when inspecting the software
	at run-time, these abstractions are no longer visible. While inspection,
	monitoring and management are increasingly important in our always-online
	world, they are often only possible in terms of the lower-level abstraction
	of the underlying platform. Due to the complexity of current programming
	languages and middleware, this low-level information is too complex
	to handle or understand. This paper presents a run-time inspection
	system based on dynamic model transformation capabilities that extends
	run-time entities with higher-level abstract views, in order to enable
	inspection in terms of the original and most relevant abstractions.
	Our solution is lightweight in terms of performance overhead and
	agile in the sense that it can selectively (and on-demand) generate
	these high-level views. Our prototype implementation has been applied
	to inspect distributed applications using RMI. In this case study,
	we inspect the distributed RMI system using our integrated overview
	over the collection of distributed objects that interact using remote
	method invocation. Â© 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information

	companies have adopted system development methodologies. Various
	evaluation methods and frameworks exist in the literature to assist
	companies during their adoption phase. However, a need was identified
	to evaluate the efficiency of a system development methodology after
	adoption. In an era where there is a reappraisal of the usefulness
	of system development methodologies it is essential to have a valid
	and reliable method of evaluation. The aim of this paper is to propose
	an evaluation model to measure post-implementation efficiency of
	a software development methodology. Data Envelopment Analysis, a
	linear programming method, is investigated as a means to evaluate
	efficiency of a SDM after adoption. This paper focus on the Scrum
	software development methodology as it is a popular methodology in
	use today. With Data Envelopment Analysis it is possible to classify
	different companies' use of Scrum as efficient or inefficient. The
	results also make it possible to identify specific areas in a company
	that needs improvement. These individual recommendations can be applied
	to increase the post-implementation efficiency of a company's systems

	in order to improve information systems development. Various factors
	influencing the successful adoption of system development methodologies
	have been identified by numerous studies. However, a need was identified
	to evaluate the post-implementation efficiency of system development
	methodologies. The aim of this paper is to present theoretical and
	empirical background for an evaluation model to measure the efficiency
	of a software development methodology after implementation. A linear
	programming method called Data Envelopment Analysis was used to compare
	the application of the Extreme Programming system development methodology
	in different organizations. According to the results of the analysis,
	it was possible to classify organizations' use of Extreme Programming
	as efficient or inefficient. Recommendations could be made to increase
	efficiency of individual organizations that were classified as inefficient.

  abstract = {The SuperAGILE experiment is the hard X-ray monitor of the AGILE mission.
	It is a 2 x one-dimensional imager, with 6-arcmin angular resolution
	in the energy range 18 - 60 keV and a field of view in excess of
	1 steradian. SuperAGILE is successfully operating in orbit since
	Summer 2007, providing long-term monitoring of bright sources and
	prompt detection and localization of gamma-ray bursts. Starting on
	October 2009 the AGILE mission lost its reaction wheel and the satellite
	attitude is no longer stabilized. The current mode of operation of
	the AGILE satellite is a Spinning Mode, around the Sun-pointing direction,
	with an angular velocity of about 0.8 degree/s (corresponding to
	8 times the SuperAGILE point spread function every second). In these
	new conditions, SuperAGILE continuously scans a much larger fraction
	of the sky, with much smaller exposure to each region. In this paper
	we review some of the results of the first 2.5 years of "standard"
	operation of SuperAGILE, and show how new implementations in the
	data analysis software allows to continue the hard X-ray sky monitoring
	by SuperAGILE also in the new attitude conditions. Â© 2010 SPIE.},

  abstract = {Kerosene-type fuels are the most common aviation fuel, and an understanding
	of their combustion properties is essential for achieving optimized
	gas turbine operation. Presently, however, there is lack of experimental
	flame speed data available by which to validate the chemical kinetic
	mechanisms necessary for effective computational studies. In this
	study, premixed jet fuel surrogate blends and commercial kerosene
	are studied using particle image velocimetry in a stagnation flame
	geometry. Numerical simulations of each experiment are obtained using
	the CHEMKIN-PRO software package and the JetSurF 2.0 mechanism. The
	neat hydrocarbon surrogates investigated include n-decane, methylcyclohexane,
	and toluene, which represent the alkane, cycloalkane, and aromatic
	components of conventional aviation fuel, respectively. Two blends
	are studied in this paper. The first is a binary blend formulated
	to reproduce the laminar flame speed of aviation fuel using a mixing
	rule based on the laminar flame speed and adiabatic flame temperature
	of the hydrocarbon components, weighted by their respective mixture
	mole fractions. The second blend is a tertiary blend formulated to
	emulate the hydrogen to carbon ratio of the kerosene studied. All
	of the considered fuels and blends are studied at three equivalence
	ratios, corresponding to lean, stoichiometric, and rich conditions,
	and at several stretch rates. The centreline axial velocity profiles
	from numerical simulations are directly compared to the measured
	velocity profiles to validate the mechanism at each condition. The
	difference between the experimental and simulated reference flame
	speed is used to infer the true unstretched laminar flame speed of
	the mixture. These results allow the effectiveness of the different
	blending methodologies to be assessed. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.},

  abstract = {Agile Project Management (APM) is widely used in different software
	projects from different application domains. APM includes a series
	of commonly used project management approaches with the intent to
	handle better uncertainty and unpredictability, which is not always
	successful. For instance, in a large portion of software projects,
	accurate planning (and estimating) of whole project lifetime with
	Agile is difficult. Since a continuously change in (product) requirements
	occurs as well their incompleteness at the project initialization
	phase, project plan must be under control and continuously be revised
	according to its needs and resources. In Agile projects, planning
	is mainly based on guess estimate of the effort trying to balance
	the product and the resources not showing the part of each one. In
	order to improve the guess estimate, this paper proposes an approach
	moving from the COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) worked, using the
	COSMIC measurement method at the micro-level (User Stories) jointly
	with the quality of the documentation for deploying the functional
	analysis. The proposed procedure shows that this approach can help
	the planner to know better why the global effort changes by the time.},

  abstract = {The Department of Surgery at the University Of Washington School Of
	Medicine is faced with the challenge of providing IT security to
	faculty, researchers, and staff within a clinical hospital environment
	and at multiple sites. Many departmental faculty and staff use laptops
	running Windows XP and often find it necessary to travel to multiple
	locations throughout the day or week. Additionally, regulations such
	as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
	and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) mandate
	the protection of protected health information (PHI) and student
	data that many members of the department interact with as a normal
	part of their work. Such data stored on departmental laptops must
	be secured. Concerned with data security, the department is deploying
	PGP Universal in order to protect this fleet of laptops with a centrally
	managed, whole disk encryption solution. A centrally managed whole
	disk encryption solution was desired for both Windows XP and a small
	number of Macintosh laptops, but not available for the latter. The
	Department of Surgery IT Services Group (ITSG) selected PGP Universal
	for the Windowsbased solution and monitors PGP Corporation's ongoing
	development of a Mac OS X whole disk encryption solution. ITSG staff
	tested PGP and a deployment process was developed in the hopes of
	avoiding technical problems. Minor installation problems that did
	occur were found to be the result of computing staff's deviation
	from installation procedures. The amount of time required to deploy
	the solution across the department was underestimated; the project
	has taken additional time for several reasons, including the difficulty
	in coordinating installations with a mobile workforce; a number of
	competing, large scale products; and possibly the ITSG organizational
	structure. While the use of PGP whole disk encryption has necessitated
	a change in behavior for both laptop users and ITSG staff, these
	changes are minor and can be addressed with careful planning and
	forethought. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

  abstract = {Background: Left cervical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) using the
	implanted NeuroCybernetic Prosthesis (NCP®) can reduce epileptic
	seizures and has recently been shown to give promising results for
	treating therapy-resistant depression. To address a disadvantage
	of this state-of-the-art VNS device, the use of an alternative transcutaneous
	electrical nerve stimulation technique, designed for muscular stimulation,
	was studied. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been
	used to test non-invasively access nerve structures associated with
	the vagus nerve system. The results and their impact are unsatisfying
	due to missing brainstem activations. These activations, however,
	are mandatory for reasoning, higher subcortical and cortical activations
	of vagus nerve structures. The objective of this study was to test
	a new parameter setting and a novel device for performing specific
	(well-controlled) transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) at the inner side of
	the tragus. This paper shows the feasibility of these and their potential
	for brainstem and cerebral activations as measured by blood oxygenation
	level dependent functional MRI (BOLD fMRI). Materials and methods:
	In total, four healthy male adults were scanned inside a 1.5-Tesla
	MR scanner while undergoing tVNS at the left tragus. We ensured that
	our newly developed tVNS stimulator was adapted to be an MR-safe
	stimulation device. In the experiment, cortical and brainstem representations
	during tVNS were compared to a baseline. Results: A positive BOLD
	response was detected during stimulation in brain areas associated
	with higher order relay nuclei of vagal afferent pathways, respectively
	the left locus coeruleus, the thalamus (left ≫ right), the left
	prefrontal cortex, the right and the left postcentral gyrus, the
	left posterior cingulated gyrus and the left insula. Deactivations
	were found in the right nucleus accumbens and the right cerebellar
	hemisphere. Conclusion: The method and device are feasible and appropriate
	for accessing cerebral vagus nerve structures, respectively. As functional
	patterns share features with fMRI BOLD, the effects previously studied
	with the NCP® are discussed and new possibilities of tVNS are hypothesised.

	calculating the long-term cost of software in agile production environments.
	The evaluation focuses on the effects of the production infrastructure

  abstract = {We present a high fidelity cognitive radio (CR) network emulation
	platform for wireless system tests, measure- ments, and validation.
	This versatile platform provides the configurable functionalities
	to control and repeat realistic physical channel effects in integrated
	space, air, and ground networks. We combine the advantages of scalable
	simulation environment with reliable hardware performance for high
	fidelity and repeatable evaluation of heterogeneous CR networks.
	This approach extends CR design only at device (software-defined-radio)
	or lower-level protocol (dynamic spectrum access) level to end-to-end
	cognitive networking, and facilitates low-cost deployment, development,
	and experimentation of new wireless network protocols and applications
	on frequency- agile programmable radios. Going beyond the channel
	emulator paradigm for point-to-point communications, we can support
	simultaneous transmissions by network-level emulation that allows
	realistic physical-layer inter- actions between diverse user classes,
	including secondary users, primary users, and adversarial jammers
	in CR networks. In particular, we can replay field tests in a lab
	environment with real radios perceiving and learning the dynamic
	environment thereby adapting for end-to-end goals over distributed
	spectrum coordination channels that replace the common control channel
	as a single point of failure. CR networks offer several dimensions
	of tunable actions including channel, power, rate, and route selection.
	The proposed network evaluation platform is fully programmable and
	can reliably evaluate the necessary cross-layer design solutions
	with configurable op- timization space by leveraging the hardware
	experiments to represent the realistic effects of physical channel,
	topology, mobility, and jamming on spectrum agility, situational
	awareness, and network resiliency. We also provide the flexibility
	to scale up the test environment by introducing virtual radios and
	establishing seamless signal-level interactions with real radios.
	This holistic wireless evaluation approach supports a large-scale,
	het- erogeneous, and dynamic CR network architecture and allows developing
	cross-layer network protocols under high fidelity, repeatable, and
	scalable wireless test scenarios suitable for heterogeneous space,
	air, and ground networks. Â© 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical

	low NOX combustor concept developed by United Technologies Aerospace
	Systems for NASA's Environmentally Responsible Aircraft program.
	The multipoint lean direct injection system employed substitutes
	five radially distributed rows of injectors for a single row of larger
	nozzles. The nozzles are grouped into three independently controlled
	fuel stages featuring differing air swirler and fuel injector design.
	The R-8 biofuel remains lit at a slightly lower overall fuel to air
	ratio (FAR) of 0.0054 compared to Jet A which extinguishes at a FAR
	of 0.0055. Emissions measurements for NOX, UHC, and CO are presented
	at different equivalence ratios, pressures, and staging configurations.
	OH* chemiluminescence images help explain the observed emissions
	trends. These images also demonstrate how the reaction zone changes
	drastically depending on the fuel stage configuration. The maximum
	NOx production using the pilot stage alone is measured when the local
	equivalence ratio (calculated from air and fuel flow through the
	pilot stage) is slightly above stoichiometric. In this pilot-only
	mode, there is very little difference in emissions between the R-8
	and Jet A fuels. In the two-stage configuration with constant equivalence
	ratio, increasing the relative amount of fuel sent to the second
	stage decreases the NOX production significantly. For these configurations
	there are large differences between R-8 and Jet A in that the biofuel
	produces more NOX emissions. In a three-stage mode a well distributed
	and low temperature reaction zone with low NOX production is demonstrated.
	The R-8 biofuel again shows more NOX emissions but the size of this
	difference is dependent on the fuel distribution.},

  abstract = {Context: There are lots of approaches or methodologies in the Model-Driven
	Web Engineering (MDWE) context to develop Web Applications without
	reaching a consensus on the use of standards and scarcity of both,
	practical experience and tool support. Objective: Model-Driven Web
	Engineering (MDWE) methodologies are constantly evolving. Moreover,
	Quality is a very important factor to identify within a methodology
	as it defines processes, techniques and artifacts to develop Web
	Applications. For this reason, when analyzing a methodology, it is
	not only necessary to evaluate quality, but also to find out how
	to improve it. The main goal of this paper is to develop a set of
	Quality Characteristics and Sub-Characteristics for MDWE approaches
	based on ISO/IEC standards. Method: From the software products context,
	some widely standards proposed, such as ISO/IEC 9126 or ISO/IEC 25000,
	suggest a Quality Model for software products, although up to now,
	there are no standard methods to assess quality on MDWE methodologies.
	Such methodologies can be organized into Properties, thus, a methodology
	has artifacts, processes and techniques. Then, each item is evaluated
	through a set of appropriate Quality Characteristics, depending on
	its nature. This paper proposes to evaluate a methodology as a product
	itself. Results: This paper recommends a set of Quality Characteristics
	and Sub-Characteristics based on these standards in order to evaluate
	MDWE methodologies quality. Additionally, it defines an agile way
	to relate these Quality Sub-Characteristics to Properties with the
	sole purpose of not only analyzing, but also assessing and improving
	MDWE methodologies. Conclusions: The application of these Quality
	Characteristics and Sub-Characteristics could promote efficiency
	in methodologies since this kind of assessment enhances both the
	understanding of strengths and weaknesses of approaches. Â© 2012

	for the next iteration is critical for success of eXtreme Programming
	(XP). Success here is measured by the total business value generated
	from all user stories implemented within time. The business value
	of an iteration is composed by the value of the individual user stories
	selected and additional value created from themes of user stories.
	In this paper, a method combining advanced search and risk analysis
	is proposed to support decision-making for the "best" set of user
	stories. The advanced search technique combines genetic search with
	subsequent application of the hill climbing technique. The top candidate
	solutions are further analyzed pro-actively in terms of their risk
	to be implementable in-time with the available effort. As a proof-of-concept,
	the applicability of the proposed method is applied for the planning
	of one iteration in a case study project with 40 user stories. As
	a result, a set of trade-off solutions is offered as decision support
	for XP teams. Â© 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Wireless sensor network (WSN) is recently emerged as a powerful tool
	in the structural health monitoring (SHM). Due to the limitations
	of wireless channel capacity and the heavy data traffic, the control
	on the network is usually not real time. On the other hand, many
	SHM applications require quick response when unexpected events, such
	as earthquake, happen. Realizing the need to have an agile monitoring
	system, an approach, called sandwich node, was proposed. Sandwich
	is a design of complex sensor node where two Imote2 nodes are connected
	with each other to enhance the capabilities of the sensing units.
	The extra channel and processing power, added into the nodes, enable
	agile responses of the sensing network, particularly in interrupting
	the network and altering the undergoing tasks for burst events. This
	paper presents the design of a testbed for examination of the performance
	of wireless sandwich nodes in a network. The designed elements of
	the network are the software architecture of remote and local nodes,
	and the triggering strategies for coordinating the sensing units.
	The performance of the designed network is evaluated through its
	implementation in a monitoring test in the laboratory. For both original
	Imote2 and the sandwich node, the response time is estimated. The
	results show that the sandwich node is an efficient solution to the
	collision issue in existing interrupt approaches and the latency
	in dense wireless sensor networks. Â© 2012 SPIE.},

	have found that personal roles may raise teammates' personal accountability
	while maintaining the essence of the software development method.
	In this paper we present our role scheme, elaborate on its implementation
	and explain how it can be used to derive metrics. We illustrate our
	ideas by data gathered in student projects in the university. Â©

	testing. The introduction of Extreme Programming (XP) - the most
	common agile software development method - into an organization is
	accompanied with conceptual and organizational changes. These changes

	an informative project environment) and continue with changes on
	the management level (e.g., meeting and listening to the customer
	during the whole process and the concept of the whole team which
	means that all role holders are part of the team). This paper examines
	the process of transition to an agile development process in a large-scale
	software project in the Israeli Air Force as it is perceived from
	the system analysis and design perspective. Specifically, the project
	specifications of the agile team are compared with those of a team
	who continues working according to the previous heavyweight method
	during the first half year of transition. Size and complexity measures
	are used as the basis of the comparison. In addition to the inspection
	of the specifications, the change in the role of the system analysts,

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of measuring the completeness of software
	requirements implementation and of comparing multiple software products
	based on the same requirements specification, by using an original
	approach settled on a vector-based method. The application of this
	method is presented in a practical way, by analyzing 6 software products
	using two different development processes: UPEDU - a scaled-down
	version of the organized process RUP and XP - a member of the agile
	methodologies. An experts' committee measured and analyzed the realization
	quality of each of 109 requirements of equal importance and judged
	them based on an evaluation vector system. Two groups of requirements
	were identified referring dynamic functions and static functions
	of the system. The observational study was conducted in an academic
	environment. An important contribution of this paper is the vector-based
	comparison method that could be generalized and applied in any other
	setting. The findings of this empirical study point to a potential
	link that may exist between the quality of the implemented requirements
	and the process used by the development teams.},

	for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER)
	at the University of California, Berkeley. The NRAO has been concurrently
	developing GUPPI software and hardware using minimal software resources.
	The software handles instrument monitor and control, data acquisition,
	and hardware interfacing. GUPPI is currently an expert-only spectrometer,
	but supports future integration with the full GBT production system.
	The NRAO was able to take advantage of the unique flexibility of
	the CASPER FPGA hardware platform, develop hardware and software
	in parallel, and build a suite of software tools for monitoring,
	controlling, and acquiring data with a new instrument over a short
	timeline of just a few months. The NRAO interacts regularly with
	CASPER and its users, and GUPPI stands as an example of what reconfigurable
	computing and open-source development can do for radio astronomy.
	GUPPI is modular for portability, and the NRAO provides the results
	of development as an open-source resource.},

	uncooled long wave infrared (thermal) cameras, while the concept
	itself is not restricted to those cameras. Every component of the
	setup like black body source, climate chamber, remote power switch,
	and the camera itself is connected to a network via Ethernet and
	a Windows XP workstation is controlling all components by the use
	of the TCL - script language. Beside the job of communicating with
	the components the script tool is also capable to run Matlab code
	via the matlab kernel. Data exchange during the measurement is possible
	and offers a variety of different advantages from drastically reduction
	of the amount of data to enormous speedup of the measuring procedure
	due to data analysis during measurement. A parameter based software
	framework is presented to create generic test cases, where modification
	the test scenario does not require any programming skills. In the
	second part of the paper the measurement results of a elf developed
	GigE-Vision thermal camera are presented and correction algorithms,
	providing high quality image output, are shown. These algorithms
	are fully implemented in the FPGA of the camera to provide real time
	processing while maintaining GigE-Vision as standard transmission
	protocol as an interface to arbitrary software tools. Artefacts taken

	of equivalence ratio and hydrogen concentration at flame flashback
	have been made at pressures ranging from 1 to 8 atmospheres, hydrogen
	concentration in the fuel of 60 to 100% and inlet velocities of 10,
	20, 40 and 80 m/s. Increasing the hydrogen concentration in the fuel
	was found to significantly lower the equivalence ratio at flashback.
	This was believed to be the result of the much higher flame speed
	for hydrogen compared to methane. Increasing pressure was found to
	also decrease the equivalence ratio at flashback, while increasing
	the inlet velocity was found to increase the equivalence ratio at
	flashback. Two of these experiments were reproduced numerically using
	the FLUENT™ software. Numerical data were found to be in good agreement
	with experimental data at atmospheric pressure. The flashback process
	was investigated using the numerical data.},

	A high percentage of IS projects fail to meet efficiency metrics
	of on time, on budget, and on initial specifications. Even when projects
	meet these efficiency metrics, recent research and experience show
	that they fail to deliver business benefits. This paper presents
	an appreciative enquiry of a successful IS project that delivered
	an innovative business solution that was highly appreciated and valued
	by the business. Analysis of post-project data reveals the resemblance
	of the project practices with the creation of a collective mindfulness.
	It suggests that the project practices supported by an Agile software
	development method allowed the organization the opportunity to create
	a 'bubble' of collective mindfulness. This bubble of collective mindfulness
	had the capacity to sustain a high level of vigilance and sensitivity
	to business operations and needs which fostered business innovation
	and the delivery of a successful solution. The paper empirically
	contributes to the understanding of how IS project management could
	enable business innovation. Practitioners are invited to create a
	mindful organization for IS projects that embraces change and fosters
	business innovation. Â© (2009) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office

	was found also that the sound pressure level is dependent not only
	on the equivalence ratio but also on the upstream mixture velocity.},

  abstract = {According to a folk theorem, every program can be transformed into
	a program that produces the same output and only has one loop. We
	generalize this to a form where the resulting program has one loop
	and no other branches than the one associated with the loop control.
	For this branch, branch prediction is easy even for a static branch
	predictor. If the original program is of length Îº, measured in
	the number of assembly-language instructions, and runs in t(n) time
	for an input of size n, the transformed program is of length O(Îº)
	and runs in O(Îºt(n)) time. Normally sorting programs are short,
	but still Îº may be too large for practical purposes. Therefore,
	we provide more efficient hand-tailored heapsort and mergesort programs.
	Our programs retain most features of the original programs-e.g. they
	perform the same number of element comparisons-and they induce O(1)
	branch mispredictions. On computers where branch mispredictions were
	expensive, some of our programs were, for integer data and small
	instances, faster than the counterparts in the GNU implementation
	of the C++ standard library. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	strategies. When a software organization is about to decide on the
	adoption of a new process, it should have a clear understanding of
	its own strategic objectives, as well as the potentials of the new
	method in supporting or hindering its strategic plan. From this perspective,
	a successful process adoption initiative is one which provides maximum
	support to the strategic objectives of an organization while producing
	a minimum of adverse effects. This paper introduces the concept of
	Strategically Balanced Process Adoption (SBPA) for anticipating and
	monitoring the strategic impacts of a new process before and after
	its adoption. A set of techniques are proposed for the realization
	of SBPA, which are based on a repository of method fragments, introduced
	in an earlier ICSP paper. The proposed techniques are deployed in
	an industrial experience, where the subject organization was about
	to adopt a custom-designed agile process. The proposed techniques

	a minimal amount of project artifacts. However measuring and/or assessing
	reliability of developed software is nevertheless a very important
	task and there seems to be a natural fit between SRE and agile in
	driving certification testing. SRE typically focuses on directing
	test efforts after software has been created in order to achieve
	a pre-determined failure intensity objective (FIO). It also uses
	reliability growth models in order to predict when the software will
	meet the FIO, and therefore can be released. While these ideas may
	initially seem incompatible with the test-driven emphasis of agile
	methods, we show that SRE does in fact have value within the agile

	Evaluation showed that accuracy of estimates varies between 43% and
	55% of actual effort of historical test projects. These results outperformed

	delivering quality Functional Requirements (FRs). However, agile
	project management methodologies have not adequately captured planning
	and prioritization activities for crosscutting concerns and non-functional
	requirements in agile practices. This research proposes project management
	and requirements quality metrics that would be used to design a risk-driven
	algorithm to prioritize and plan an improved requirements implementation
	sequence that is suitable for agile software development methodologies.
	Unlike the overly simplistic business value prioritization scheme
	used in methodologies such as Scrum, Non-functional Requirements
	Planning (NORPLAN) proposes two additional prioritization schemes,
	namely, Riskiest-Requirements-First and Riskiest-Requirements-Last
	for improved yet more agile planning for release and sprint cycles
	using a risk-driven approach. The approach is validated through visual
	simulation and a case study. Â© 2013 IEEE.},

	and cross-enterprise flexible, dynamic business processes and agile

	Testing is a way to evaluate these quality attributes. However, the
	new unique architecture style of SOA-based systems calls for reorienting
	testing procedures, methods, techniques, and tools etc. In this paper
	we discuss how we can evaluate efficiency and effectiveness of SOA

	framework, we attempt to highlight areas where necessary adjustments
	to this framework are needed to care for the specialized testing

	to the complexity of traditional SD methodologies (e.g. Waterfall)
	and their inability to cope with changes brought about by today's
	dynamic and evolving business environment. Agile methodologies (AM)
	have emerged to challenge traditional SD and overcome their limitations.
	Yet empirical research into AM is sparse. This paper develops and
	tests a research model that hypothesizes the effects of five characteristics
	of agile systems development (iterative development; continuous integration;
	test-driven design; feedback; and collective ownership) on two dependent
	stakeholder satisfaction measures, namely stakeholder satisfaction
	with the development process and with the development outcome. An
	empirical study of 59 South African development projects (using self
	reported data) provided support for all hypothesized relationships
	and generally supports the efficacy of AM. Iteration and integration
	together with collective ownership have the strongest effects on
	the dependent satisfaction measures. Copyright Â© 2008 ACM.},

	In this paper we describe a new data analysis system that provides
	a scalable, flexible system for composing ad-hoc analyses of high-speed,
	streaming data. This agility allows researchers, network security
	analysts, or network operators to easily compose new analysis functions.
	A growing tool box of filtering, measurement, and statistical tools
	allows new approaches to be tested with a minimum of software development.
	Further, a dynamic type system allows polymorphic analysis modules
	to operate on arbitrary forms of structured data, thus allowing easy
	integration of multiple data sources such as packet traces, netflow
	records, or security logs. In this paper we present this system and
	demonstrate its capabilities while performing several measurements,
	such as computing probability density functions, detecting port-scans,
	and probabilistic counting of traffic traces.},

	development projects and organisations. However, there is not much
	known about the tailoring and engineering of agile methods, or about
	how these methods can be used to complement each other. This study
	investigated tailoring of the agile methods, eXtreme programming
	(XP) and Scrum, at Intel Shannon, and involved experienced software
	engineers who continuously monitored and reflected on these methods
	over a 3-year period. The study shows that agile methods may individually
	be incomplete in supporting the overall development process, but
	XP and Scrum complement each other well, with XP providing support
	for technical aspects and Scrum providing support for project planning
	and tracking. The principles of XP and Scrum were carefully selected
	(only six of the 12 XP key practices were implemented, for example)
	and tailored to suit the needs of the development environment at
	Intel Shannon. Thus, the study refutes the suggestion that agile
	methods are not divisible or individually selectable but achieve
	their benefits through the synergistic combination of individual
	agile practices; rather, this study shows that an a la carte selection
	and tailoring of practices can work very well. In the case of Scrum,
	some local tailoring has led to a very committed usage by developers,
	in contrast to many development methods whose usage is limited despite
	being decreed mandatory by management. The agile practices that were
	applied did lead to significant benefits, including reductions in
	code defect density by a factor of 7. Projects of 6-month and 1-year
	duration have been delivered ahead of schedule, which bodes well
	for future ability to accurately plan development projects. Â©

  abstract = {Refactoring is recognized as an essential practice in the context
	of evolutionary and agile software development. Recognizing the importance
	of the practice, modern IDEs provide some support for low-level refactorings.
	A notable exception in the list of supported refactorings is the
	"Extract Class" refactoring, which is conceived to simplify large,
	complex, unwieldy and less cohesive classes. In this work, we describe
	a method and a tool, implemented as an Eclipse plugin, designed to
	fulfill exactly this need. Our method involves three steps: (a) recognition
	of Extract Class opportunities, (b) ranking of the identified opportunities
	in terms of the improvement each one is anticipated to bring about
	to the system design, and (c) fully automated application of the
	refactoring chosen by the developer. The first step relies on an
	agglomerative clustering algorithm, which identifies cohesive sets
	of class members within the system classes. The second step relies
	on the Entity Placement metric as a measure of design quality. Through
	a set of experiments we have shown that the tool is able to identify
	and extract new classes that developers recognize as "coherent concepts"
	and improve the design quality of the underlying system. Â© 2011

	a cross section survey was conducted to evaluate the presence or
	application of these factors in 11 software projects that used Scrum
	in 9 different software companies located in Recife-PE, Brazil. The
	questionnaire was applied to 65 developers and Scrum Masters, representing
	75% (65/86) of the professionals that have participated in the projects.
	The result was correlated with the level of success achieved by the
	projects, measured by the subjective perception of the project participant,
	using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The main finding is
	that only 32% (8/25) of the factors correlated positively with project
	success, raising the question of whether the factors hypothesized
	in the literature as being critical to the success of agile software
	projects indeed have an effect on project success. Given the limitations

	Lean production. The game was initially influenced by the Buckingham
	Lean Game and then adjusted to fit an infrastructure production process.
	Focus in the design process and when playing the game is on breaking

	addresses basic Lean principles and tools such as; process design,
	eliminating waste concerning for example materials and space, push

	paper is written the Lean game InFrame has been played half a dozen
	times and so far no quantitative results can be presented. However,
	three levels of reflection can be distinguished. Facing learning
	barriers when meeting practitioners in the construction industry
	is a critical issue for learning. However, games as a first introduction
	to Lean for practitioners is a rather undiscovered field of research
	and need more attention in the future. Further development and research
	need to focus on what do learners bring from playing Lean games and
	how can the learning environment for practitioners be improved.},

	Controller is one of the prototyped systems based on the concept
	of Holonic Manufacturing System. It is developed to construct a planning
	and control system of a shop and/or a cell, and experimentally applied
	to induction motor assembly planning. First, Holonic Controller constructs
	a Holonic System by generating holons from the given data. That is,
	it duplicates template holonic software, name it, and stored respective
	data. Each holon has respective instruction decomposition ability
	and instruction allocation function to other holons through negotiation.
	Secondly, Holonic Controller carries out given instructions by decomposing
	instructions in each holon and allocating decomposed instructions
	through negotiations to executable holons. Holonic Controller can
	animate and monitor its processes on computer displays and the constructed
	Holonic System can be checked. Assembly planning of induction motors
	is first testbed for Holonic Controller. About 50 holons cooperating
	each other can generate assembly plans, and the usefulness of Holonic
	Controller is verified.},

	(IM) is crucial for the adoption and application of health management
	methodologies on systems and industrial processes. Conveyor belt
	systems are subjects to speed changes along the working route and
	a big amount of start-stops cycles, this operating service causes
	on the IM a fatigue and deterioration for thermal and mechanical
	stresses. Consequently this paper presents a conveyor belt moved

  abstract = {This paper describes the impact of an agile process support environment
	in helping faculty manage software engineering capstone projects
	and the learning outcomes associated with the capstone experience.
	Software engineering capstone projects are notoriously time-consuming
	to manage for faculty mentors. Team projects often fall behind due
	to the inexperience of the students and the external pressures they
	face. They may be accustomed to performing heroic acts on prior individual
	class projects, and think they can be successful this way again.
	But in a significantly sized real-world team project, they find out
	too late that this approach will not work. Students remain successful
	often by significant effort on the part of a faculty mentor. The
	mentor may setup a process infrastructure to enables project monitoring.
	Mentors may find themselves asking for frequent in-class project
	reviews, out-of-class appointments, and significant documentation.
	Mentoring a capstone project, while a potentially rewarding experience,
	can become a significant time sink and lead to faculty burnout. We
	are utilizing the IBM Jazz environment including the Rational Team
	Concert (RTC) integrated development environment (IDE) to address
	project management for capstone projects using the Agile/Scrum methodology.
	Jazz/RTC allows all stakeholders (students, sponsors, and faculty)
	to transparently review a process to assess project health at any
	point in time. Further, transparent continuous project monitoring
	gives mentors the ability to provide just-in-time-but-not-too-late
	formative feedback, as well as allow continuous assessment of learning
	outcomes. The ability to "see where you are" in the process, and
	understand how the process' practices drive progress and completion,
	is an invaluable learning aid for students struggling to grasp the
	benefits of these methods. © American Society for Engineering Education,

  abstract = {The emergence of various software development methodologies raises
	the need to evaluate and compare their efficiencies. One way of performing
	such a comparison is to have different teams apply different process
	models in the implementation of multiple versions of common specifications.
	This study defines a new cognitive activity classification scheme
	which has been used to record the effort expended by six student
	teams producing parallel implementations of the same software requirements
	specifications. Three of the teams used a process based on the Unified
	Process for Education (UPEDU), a teaching-oriented process derived
	from the Rational Unified Process. The other three teams used a process
	built around the principles of the Extreme Programming (XP) methodology.
	Important variations in effort at the cognitive activity level between
	teams shows that the classification could scarcely be used without
	categorization at a higher level. However, the relative importance
	of a category of activities aimed at defining "active" behaviour
	was shown to be almost constant for all teams involved, possibly
	showing a fundamental behaviour pattern. As secondary observations,
	aggregate variations by process model tend to be small and limited
	to a few activities, and coding-related activities dominate the effort
	distribution for all the teams. Â© 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights

  abstract = {Accurate modeling of engine knock onset is needed for control of SI
	engine combustion and increase of thermal efficiency. This contribution
	presents a refined model for analysis of engine knock when using
	natural gas fuel and EGR. The model is used to compare the effectiveness
	of EGR to other knock suppression methods such as lean-burn combustion,
	compression ratio reduction, and ignition timing retardation. The
	model consists of two zones: a burned combustion products region
	and an unburned reactants comprising the end gas region, separated
	by a flame front of negligible thickness. A mass burning rate is
	derived from a turbulent combustion model. FORTRAN code as programming
	software is used for combustion simulation. Operating conditions
	which affect an engine's tendency to knock are discussed. The model
	was validated by comparison to experimental data. Results show that
	EGR addition is more effective at suppressing knock, while maintaining
	high thermal efficiency and output work, compared to other knock
	suppression techniques such as inlet pressure and temperature, equivalence
	ratio, spark timing, or compression ratio. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.},

	Ensuring the systems to be up and running for 24 × 7 has become

	(TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) are practices, which

	to development. For ensuring business to be truly agile, we need
	to take forward the agile approach to operations. In this paper,
	we discuss the behavior driven approach for operations specifically
	on the core sub-systems like infrastructure provisioning, deployment
	and monitoring. We share our explorations and experiments with Behavior
	Driven Monitoring (BDM) and how the same can be adopted for infrastructure
	provisioning and deployment. We used Cucumber-Nagios to detect behavior
	of an enterprise application. We close this paper with a note on

	in the need to provide energy-efficient algorithm-agile cryptographic

	the required flexibility, without incurring the high overhead costs
	associated with generic reprogrammable logic. The resulting implementation
	is capable of performing an entire suite of cryptographic primitives

	elliptic curves over GF(2 n), with fully programmable moduli, field
	polynomials and curve parameters ranging in size from 8 to 1024 bits.
	The resulting processor consumes a maximum of 75 mW when operating

	mode (3 MHz at 0.7 V) the processor consumes at most 525 μW. Measured
	performance and energy efficiency indicate a comparable level of
	performance to previously reported dedicated hardware implementations,
	while providing all of the flexibility of a software-based implementation.
	In addition, the processor is two to three orders of magnitude more

	can deliver accurate developer contribution measurements. The model
	creates clusters of similar projects to extract weights that are
	then applied to the actions a developer performed on project assets
	to extract a combined measurement of the developer's contribution.
	We are currently implementing the model in the context of a software

  abstract = {Through inward perceptions, we intuitively expect distributed software
	development to increase the risks associated with achieving cost,
	schedule, and quality goals. To compound this problem, agile software
	development (ASD) insists one of the main ingredients of its success
	is cohesive communication attributed to collocation of the development
	team. The following study identified the degree of communication
	richness needed to achieve comparable software quality (reduce pre-release
	defects) between distributed and collocated teams. This paper explores
	the relevancy of communication richness in various development phases
	and its impact on quality. Through examination of a large distributed
	agile development project, this investigation seeks to understand
	the levels of communication required within each ASD phase to produce
	comparable quality results achieved by collocated teams. Obviously,
	a multitude of factors affects the outcome of software projects.
	However, within distributed agile software development teams, the
	mode of communication is one of the critical components required
	to achieve team cohesiveness and effectiveness. As such, this study
	constructs a distributed agile communication model (DAC-M) for potential
	application to similar distributed agile development efforts using
	the measurement of the suitable level of communication. The results
	of the study show that less rich communication methods, in the appropriate
	phase, might be satisfactory to achieve equivalent quality in distributed
	ASD efforts.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) scheme that is specifically
	directed towards 3D graphics-intensive interactive game applications
	running on battery-operated portable devices. The key to this DVS
	scheme lies in parsing each game frame to estimate its rendering
	workload and then using such an estimate to scale the voltage/frequency
	of the underlying processor. The main novelty of this scheme stems
	from the fact that game frames offer a rich variety of "structural"
	information (e.g. number of brush and alias models, texture information
	and light maps) which can be exploited to estimate their processing
	workload. Although DVS has been extensively applied to video decoding
	applications, compressed video frames do not offer any information
	(beyond the frame types - I, B or P) that can be used in a similar
	manner to estimate their processing workload. As a result, DVS algorithms
	designed for video decoding mostly rely on control-theoretic feedback
	mechanisms, where the workload of a frame is predicted from the workloads
	of the previously-rendered frames. We show that compared to such
	history-based predictors, our proposed scheme performs significantly
	better for game applications. Our experimental results, based on
	the Quake II game engine running on Windows XP, show that for the
	same energy consumption our scheme results in more than 50% improvement
	in quality (measured in terms of number of frames meeting their deadlines)
	compared to history-based prediction schemes. © 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Purpose - Generally, the implementation of lean manufacturing (LM)
	starts with the development of value stream maps. However, it has
	been found that value stream mapping (VSM) suffers from various shortcomings.
	Hence, researchers have suggested the use of simulation along with
	VSM. The purpose of this paper is to present an application of VSM
	with simulation during the design of lean manufacturing systems (LMS)
	using a case study of an organisation following a job shop production
	system to manufacture doors and windows. Design/methodology/approach
	- Simulation models were developed using QUeuing Event Simulation
	Tool for the case organisation to demonstrate how the case organisation
	will be changed after implementing various LM elements, apart from
	analysing the impact of implementing these LM elements on the organisation's
	performance. Findings - Simulation studies were carried out for different
	scenarios such as "beforeLM" (current state VSM) and "after LM" (future
	state VSM). It was found that the case organisation can achieve significant
	improvement in performance and can meet the increasing demand without
	any additional resources. Practical implications - It is believed
	that this paper will enable practitioners to appreciate the role
	of simulation in helping them understand how the operations department
	of the case organisation will be transformed during the design of
	LMS. Originality/value - According to the authors' knowledge, no
	case study exists in the literature that discusses the application
	ofVSMwith simulation in an organisation thatmanufactures doors and
	windows using a job shop production system. Furthermore, the paper
	simulates the impact of those LM elements which were not considered
	by other researchers on the performance measure of the case organisation.

  abstract = {To be relevant to the goals of an enterprise, an industrial software
	engineering research organization must identify problems of interest
	to, and find solutions that have an impact on, the software development
	organizations within the company. Using a systematic measurement
	program both to identify the problems and assess the impact of solutions
	is key to satisfying this need. Avaya has had such a program in place
	for about seven years. Every year we produce an annual report known
	as the State of Software in Avaya that describes software development
	trends throughout the company and that contains prioritized recommendations
	for improving Avaya's software development capabilities. We start
	by identifying the goals of the enterprise and use the goal-question-metric
	approach to identify the measures to compute. The result is insight
	into the enterprise's problems in software development, recommendations
	for improving the development process, and problems that require
	research to solve. We will illustrate the process with examples from
	the Software Technology Research Department in Avaya Labs whose purpose
	is to improve the state of software development and know it. "Know
	it" means that improvement should be subjectively evident and objectively
	quantifiable. "Know it" also means that one must be skilled at identifying
	the data sources, performing the appropriate analyses to answer the
	questions of interest, and validating that the data are accurate
	and appropriate for the purpose. Examples will include how and why
	we developed a measure of software quality that appeals to customers,
	how and why we are studying the effectiveness of distributed software
	development, and how and why we are helping development organizations
	to adopt iterative development methods. We will also discuss how
	we keep the company and the department apprised of the current strengths
	and weaknesses of software development in Avaya through the publication
	of the annual Stateof Software in Avaya Report. Our purpose is both
	to provide a model for assessment that others may emulate, based
	on seven years of experience, and to spotlight analyses and conclusions
	that we feel are common to software development today. Â© Springer

  abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Lean Thinking have been used
	separately as key approaches to overall construction projects' improvement.
	Their combination, given several scenarios, presents opportunities
	for improvement as well as challenges in implementation. However,
	the exploration of eventual interactions and relationships between
	BIM as a process and Lean Construction principles is recent in research.
	The objective of this paper is to identify BIM and Lean relationship
	aspects with a focus on the construction phase and from the perspective
	of the general contractor (GC). This paper is based on a case study
	where BIM is already heavily used by the GC and where the integration
	of Lean practices is recent. We explore areas of improvement and
	Lean contributions to BIM from two perspectives. First, from Sacks
	et al.'s (2010) Interaction Matrix perspective, we identify some
	existing interactions. Second, based on the Capability Maturity Model
	(CMM) of the National Building Information Modeling Standard (NBIMS),
	we measure the level of the project's BIM maturity and highlight
	areas of improvement for Lean. The main contribution of the paper
	is concerned with the exploration of the BIM maturity levels that
	are enhanced by Lean implementation.},

  abstract = {We present a vectorized version of the MatLab (MathWorks Inc.) package
	tweezercalib for calibration of optical tweezers with precision.
	The calibration is based on the power spectrum of the Brownian motion
	of a dielectric bead trapped in the tweezers. Precision is achieved
	by accounting for a number of factors that affect this power spectrum,
	as described in vs. 1 of the package [I.M. ToliÄ‡-NÃ¸rrelykke,
	K. Berg-SÃ¸rensen, H. Flyvbjerg, Matlab program for precision calibration
	of optical tweezers, Comput. Phys. Comm. 159 (2004) 225-240]. The
	graphical user interface allows the user to include or leave out
	each of these factors. Several "health tests" are applied to the
	experimental data during calibration, and test results are displayed
	graphically. Thus, the user can easily see whether the data comply
	with the theory used for their interpretation. Final calibration
	results are given with statistical errors and covariance matrix.

	tar. gz Nature of physical problem: Calibrate optical tweezers with
	precision by fitting theory to experimental power spectrum of position
	of bead doing Brownian motion in incompressible fluid, possibly near
	microscope cover slip, while trapped in optical tweezers. Thereby
	determine spring constant of optical trap and conversion factor for
	arbitrary-units-to- nanometers for detection system. Method of solution:
	Elimination of cross-talk between quadrant photo-diode's output channels
	for positions (optional). Check that distribution of recorded positions
	agrees with Boltzmann distribution of bead in harmonic trap. Data
	compression and noise reduction by blocking method applied to power
	spectrum. Full accounting for hydrodynamic effects: Frequency-dependent
	drag force and interaction with nearby cover slip (optional). Full
	accounting for electronic filters (optional), for "virtual filtering"
	caused by detection system (optional). Full accounting for aliasing
	caused by finite sampling rate (optional). Standard non-linear least-squares
	fitting. Statistical support for fit is given, with several plots
	facilitating inspection of consistency and quality of data and fit.
	Summary of revisions: A faster fitting routine, adapted from [J.
	Nocedal, Y.x. Yuan, Combining trust region and line search techniques,
	Technical Report OTC 98/04, Optimization Technology Center, 1998;
	W.H. Press, B.P. Flannery, S.A. Teukolsky, W.T. Vetterling, Numerical
	Recipes. The Art of Scientific Computing, Cambridge University Press,
	Cambridge, 1986], is applied. It uses fewer function evaluations,
	and the remaining function evaluations have been vectorized. Calls
	to routines in Toolboxes not included with a standard MatLab license
	have been replaced by calls to routines that are included in the
	present package. Fitting parameters are rescaled to ensure that they
	are all of roughly the same size (of order 1) while being fitted.
	Generally, the program package has been updated to comply with MatLab,
	vs. 7.0, and optimized for speed. Restrictions on the complexity
	of the problem: Data should be positions of bead doing Brownian motion
	while held by optical tweezers. For high precision in final results,
	data should be time series measured over a long time, with sufficiently
	high experimental sampling rate: The sampling rate should be well
	above the characteristic frequency of the trap, the so-called corner
	frequency. Thus, the sampling frequency should typically be larger
	than 10 kHz. The Fast Fourier Transform used works optimally when
	the time series contain 2n data points, and long measurement time
	is obtained with n>12-15. Finally, the optics should be set to ensure
	a harmonic trapping potential in the range of positions visited by
	the bead. The fitting procedure checks for harmonic potential. Typical
	running time: Seconds Unusual features of the program: None References:
	The theoretical underpinnings for the procedure are found in [K.

	feed valve for closed-loop control of abrasive flow rate. An orifice
	health sensor was developed to monitor the quality of the waterjet.
	Parameter selection software was also developed to select the optimal

	However, these models have some problems to be used with XP because
	of less number of process artifacts produced by agile processes.
	Six Sigma on the other hand, provides the quantitative analysis capabilities

	Six Sigma can provide means of analyzing XP data and systematically
	improve process performance. In order to prove our point, we map

	group estimation performance can be reduced by dominant personalities
	and anchoring effects. Through the analysis of 101 user story estimates,
	made by an XP team for release planning, we investigate whether the
	introduction of the planning poker estimation process improved the

	improved the team's estimation performance in most cases, but that

  abstract = {We introduce the observe-mine-adopt (OMA) paradigm that assists organizations
	in making improvements to their software development processes without
	committing to and undertaking large-scale sweeping organizational
	process improvement. Specifically, the approach has been applied
	to improve software practices focused on maintainability. This novel
	approach is based on the theory that software teams naturally make
	observations about things that do or do not work well. Teams then
	mine their artifacts and their recollections of events to find the
	software products, processes, metrics, etc. that led to the observation.
	In the case of software maintainability, it is then necessary to
	perform some measurement to ensure that the methods result in improved
	maintainability. We introduce two maintainability measures, maintainability
	product and perceived maintainability, to address this need. Other
	maintainability measures that may be used in the mine step are also
	examined. Finally, if the mining activities lead to validated discoveries
	of processes, techniques or practices that improve the software product,
	they are formalized and adopted by the team. OMA has been studied
	experimentally using two project studies and a Web-based health care
	system which is maintained by a large industrial software organization.

	Based on eight years of experience guiding agile software projects
	in the academia and industry, we focus in the tutorial on a coaching
	framework for agile software projects. The tutorial participants
	become familiar with coaching practices and gain experience with
	some of the practices. The tutorial has two main parts. In the first
	part, we present the coaching framework, including the goals, structure,
	and guiding principles. In the second part, we focus on the following
	central themes in agile development processes which, we suggest,
	are appropriate to be included in such a coaching framework: Teamwork
	and collaboration, time and measures, learning and reflection, and
	change and leadership. Since 2003, we have facilitated this tutorial
	and similar ones in different settings (industry, academia, conferences).
	The coaching framework, as well as the themes, case studies, and
	analysis approach presented in the tutorial, are summarized in our
	book Agile Software Engineering published by Springer in 2008 (Hazzan
	and Dubinsky, 2008). Â© 2010 ACM.},

	response to requirements changes. Formal software requirements tracing
	helps to systematically determine the impact of changes and to keep
	track of development artifacts that need to be re-tested when requirements
	change. However, full tracing of all requirements on the most detailed
	level can be very expensive and time consuming. In the paper an initial
	"tracing activity model" is introduced along with a framework that
	allows measuring the expected cost and benefit of tracing approaches.
	In a feasibility study a subset of the activities belonging to the
	model has been applied to compare three tracing strategies: agile,
	"just in time" tracing, and fully formal tracing. The study focused
	on re-testing and it has been performed in the context of an industry
	project where the customer was a large financial service provider.In
	the study a) the model was found useful to capture costs and benefits
	of the tracing activities and to compare different strategies; b)
	a combination of tracing approaches proved helpful in balancing agility
	and formalism. Â© 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {A wireless revolution is quietly taking place in global communications
	bought about by a new synergy of wireless technologies. The initial
	drivers of this synergy are primarily the low power, low cost, low
	interference wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) networks, although other wireless
	technologies, such as, WiMAX, wVoIP, Ultra Wideband, Bluetooth and
	RFID will be covered in this paper. The Wi-Fi devices (hotspots)
	can be manufactured today on a single chip in the ten-dollar range,
	and with only increased production, the cost can soon drop to less
	than one dollar. These low cost devices will be integrated - using
	a number of advanced wireless technologies, including smart antennas,
	agile radios and mesh networks all sharing breakthroughs in digital
	signal processing - into computer controlled, wireless, smart networks.
	These intelligent networks will be connected to millions and soon
	billions of new radio-frequency identification device (RFID) sensors.
	These sensors, like Wi-Fi, are built on a low cost, single chip many
	no larger than a grain of sand. The sensor data will be wirelessly
	networked to computer processing and advanced storage devices. This
	synergy, from the sensor chip via smart networks to the storage device,
	will deliver "wireless-Internet-on-a-chip" applications. These applications
	will have the capability to change the way we create things, move
	commerce and understand our world by monitoring and measuring it
	in multi-dimensions with minimal human interaction. The large numbers
	of RFID sensors can track quantities and qualities of materials and
	objects - their heat, movement and even look for probabilistic changes
	in the qualities. One of the big drivers of these active RFID/GPS
	sensors is search and location. Three major customer groups will
	spend large amounts for the ability to know where people are-all
	the time. The first group is the government who want to know where
	potential security threats are. This will include state and local
	governments who want to monitor individuals on probation and keep
	tract of certain types of offenders. The second customer group is
	businesses that want to monitor the whereabouts of their decision
	makers. Business owners are also tired of not knowing where their
	salesmen are on a Friday afternoon. The third customer group is parents
	- primarily mothers, who want to know where their children are -
	all the time. These three customer groups will propel the synergy
	of location seasors, smart, agile wireless hardware and software
	and low-cost networks. These sensor driven networks can vary from
	large, sophisticated, computer controlled systems to small data gathering
	networks, operating in the developing world. Especially in the developing
	world, these sensors will largely operate in wireless local area
	networks (WLANs) connected to simple, satellite ground terminals.
	These sensor networks will have little or no latency requirements
	and thus will be especially satellite friendly. This new revolution
	of chip-driven, wireless, low cost sensors, networks and applications
	will provide important new markets for communications satellites.},

  abstract = {Unit testing component-based distributed systems traditionally involves
	testing functional concerns of the application logic throughout the
	software lifecycle. In contrast, testing non-functional distributed
	system concerns (e.g., end-to-end response time, security, and reliability)
	typically does not occur until system integration because it requires
	a complete system to perform such tests, as well as sophisticated
	techniques to identify and analyze performance metrics that constitute
	non-functional concerns. Unit testing non-functional concerns is
	even harder in an agile development environment, due to the disconnect
	between high-level system specification and low-level performance
	metrics. This paper describes a methodology and tool called Understanding
	Non-functional Intentions via Testing and Experimentation (UNITE).
	UNITE is designed to unit test nonfunctional concerns of three component-based
	distributed systems. The results from applying UNITE to a componentbased
	distributed system show how it simplifies unit testing and evaluation
	of non-functional properties during the early stages of the software
	lifecycle.},

	from biomedical optical and imaging platforms of tissues. A shift
	from individuals to teams, partnerships, and total participation
	are necessary from health care groups for improved prognostics using
	measurement analysis. Proprietary measurement analysis software is
	available for calibrated, pixel-to-pixel measurements of angles and
	distances in digital images. Feature size, count, and color are determinable
	on an absolute and comparative basis. Although changes in images
	of histomics are based on complex and numerous factors, the variation
	of changes in imaging analysis to correlations of time, extent, and
	progression of illness can be derived. Statistical methods are preferred.
	Applications of the proprietary measurement software are available
	for any imaging platform. Quantification of results provides improved
	categorization of illness towards better health. As health care practitioners
	try to use quantified measurement data for patient diagnosis, the
	techniques reported can be used to track and isolate causes better.
	Comparisons, norms, and trends are available from processing of measurement
	data which is obtained easily and quickly from Scientific Software
	and methods. Example results for the class actions of Preventative
	and Corrective Care in Ophthalmology and Dermatology, respectively,
	are provided. Improved and quantified diagnosis can lead to better

	improvements towards Lean and Six Sigma affecting all branches of
	biology and medicine. As an example for use of statistics, the major
	types of variation involving a study of Bone Mineral Density (BMD)
	are examined. Typically, special causes in medicine relate to illness
	and activities; whereas, common causes are known to be associated
	with gender, race, size, and genetic make-up. Such a strategy of
	Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) involves comparison of patient
	results to baseline data using F-statistics. Self-parings over time
	are also useful. Special and common causes are identified apart from
	aging in applying the statistical methods. In the future, implementation
	of imaging measurement methods by research staff, doctors, and concerned
	patient partners result in improved health diagnosis, reporting,
	and cause determination. The long-term prospects for quantified measurements
	are better quality in imaging analysis with applications of higher
	utility for heath care providers. Â© 2009 SPIE.},

  abstract = {A routine for histogram analysis of images has been written in the
	object-oriented, graphical development environment LabVIEW. The program
	converts an RGB bitmap image into an intensity-linear greyscale image
	according to selectable conversion coefficients. This greyscale image
	is subsequently analysed by plots of the intensity histogram and
	probability distribution of brightness, and by calculation of various
	parameters, including average brightness, standard deviation, variance,
	minimal and maximal brightness, mode, skewness and kurtosis of the
	histogram and the median of the probability distribution. The program
	allows interactive selection of specific regions of interest (ROI)
	in the image and definition of lower and upper threshold levels (e.g.,
	to permit the removal of a constant background signal). The results
	of the analysis of multiple images can be conveniently saved and
	exported for plotting in other programs, which allows fast analysis
	of relatively large sets of image data. The program file accompanies
	this manuscript together with a detailed description of two application
	examples: The analysis of fluorescence microscopy images, specifically
	of tau-immunofluorescence in primary cultures of rat cortical and
	hippocampal neurons, and the quantification of protein bands by Western-blot.
	The possibilities and limitations of this kind of analysis are discussed.
	Program summary: Title of program: HAWGC. Catalogue identifier: ADXG_v1_0.
	Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADXG_v1_0.
	Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University

	Duron. Installations: No installation necessary-Executable file together
	with necessary files for LabVIEW Run-time engine. Operating systems
	or monitors under which the program has been tested: WindowsME/2000/XP.
	Programming language used: LabVIEW 7.0. Memory required to execute
	with typical data:âˆ¼ 16 MB for starting and âˆ¼ 160 MB used
	for loading of an image. No. of bits in a word: 32. No. of processors
	used: 1. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: No. No of
	lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.:138 946.
	No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.:15
	166 675. Distribution format: tar.gz. Nature of physical problem:
	Quantification of image data (e.g., for discrimination of molecular
	species in gels or fluorescent molecular probes in cell cultures)
	requires proprietary or complex software packages, which might not
	include the relevant statistical parameters or make the analysis
	of multiple images a tedious procedure for the general user. Method
	of solution: Tool for conversion of RGB bitmap image into luminance-linear
	image and extraction of luminance histogram, probability distribution,
	and statistical parameters (average brightness, standard deviation,
	variance, minimal and maximal brightness, mode, skewness and kurtosis
	of histogram and median of probability distribution) with possible
	selection of region of interest (ROI) and lower and upper threshold
	levels. Restrictions on the complexity of the problem: Does not incorporate
	application-specific functions (e.g., morphometric analysis). Typical
	running time: Seconds (depending on image size and processor speed).

	This model was designed to be especially useful for VSEs/SMEs. If
	VSEs/SMEs are aware of the current capability status of their software
	processes and have a improvement guideline based on their quality
	targets, they might be able to substantially improve their processes.
	To support organizations on their way to better processes, we present
	the design of a generic tool (SPIALS: Software Process Improvement
	Adaptive Learning System) applicable to measure up organizations'
	process capability status. VSEs/SMEs can use the tool to perform
	a self-assessment thus reducing the complex appraisal process. The
	measurement represents trend of practices which VSEs/SMEs should
	implement or avoid. The presented tool-based assessment strategy
	is based on Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement
	(SCAMPI), which is well recognized for CMMI standard appraisal. Â©

  abstract = {In this paper we propose a tool-based approach called CMMIbyScrum
	to improve CMMI-based processes with Agile technique such as Scrum.
	This model was designed to be especially useful for VSEs/SMEs. If
	VSEs/SMEs are aware of the current capability status of their software
	processes and have an improvement guideline based on their quality
	targets, they might be able to substantially improve their processes.
	To support organizations on their way to better processes, we present
	the design of a generic tool (SPIALS: Software Process Improvement
	Adaptive Learning System) applicable to measure up organizations'
	process capability status. VSEs/SMEs can use the tool to perform
	a self-assessment thus reducing the complex appraisal process. The
	measurement represents trend of practices which VSEs/SMEs should
	implement or avoid. The presented tool-based assessment strategy
	is based on Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement
	(SCAMPI), which is well recognized for CMMI standard appraisal. In
	this version, we propose an enhancement of questionnaire framework
	based on a light-weight for Software Process Improvement Self-Assessment
	Tool called QF-SPISAT to help practitioner in assessment process.
	Thus, the completion of user interface, gap and software process
	improvement (SPI) proposal report are presented.},

	e-commerce software projects. While the waterfall process was used
	in the past, outsourced projects experienced more delays and failures
	than the ones conducted in-house. To overcome such limitations, we
	decided to tailor the scrum method on three aspects: First, we produced
	a table that explains roles and responsibilities of project team
	members for every phase of the Scrum methodology. Second, we divided
	sprint planning into two phases, a master sprint plan and individual
	sprint plans. Finally, we monitored project progress based on the
	number of completed web pages. Application of the modified scrum
	method on two projects not only improved product quality but also
	reduced time necessary to complete the project. More than 80% of
	the software engineers also expressed satisfaction of the proposed
	approach. Â© 2010 IEEE.},

	have been discussed in the HCI community to aid older adults and
	others in pointing tasks. We present a different approach in PointAssist,
	software that aids in pointing tasks by analyzing the characteristics
	of sub-movements, detecting when users have difficulty pointing,
	and triggering a precision mode that slows the speed of the cursor
	in those cases. PointAssist is designed to help maintain pointing
	skills, runs as a background process working with existing software,
	is not vulnerable to clusters of targets or targets in the way, and
	does not modify the visual appearance or the feel of user interfaces.
	There is evidence from a prior study that PointAssist helps young
	children conduct pointing tasks. In this paper, we present a study
	evaluating PointAssist with twenty older adults (ages 66-88). The
	study participants benefited from greater accuracy when using PointAssist,
	when compared to using the "enhance pointer precision" option in
	Windows XP. In addition, we provide evidence of correlations between

  abstract = {In 2006, Taiwan joins the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
	regional GNSS test bed demonstration project, the goal is to facilitate
	the implementation and operation of a satellite based aviation navigation
	system. The reference stations are placed in seven economies including
	Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia
	and Taiwan. Among them, Australia uses one reference station from
	its current GRAS network and the reference station in Taiwan is developed
	by National Cheng Kung University. This APEC regional GNSS test bed
	is operational in September 2006. For the further extension of this
	network in Taiwan, we develop a GNSS augmentation system evaluation
	module which includes several reference station modules and one master
	station all with low-cost and flexible architecture, and we could
	quickly implement this GNSS augmentation system evaluation module
	in a region with interested. This paper presents the architecture
	of this GNSS augmentation system evaluation module. This evaluation
	module includes several GNSS reference station modules and one master
	station module. The reference station software could process the
	GNSS observation data from the GNSS receiver into a designate message
	formats, and then transmit these messages to the master station module
	via Internet. Because the communication link is Internet, the master
	station software needs to synchronize incoming messages from the
	time delay caused by Internet, then the master station decode all
	of the messages for monitoring, differential corrections processing
	and observation data logging. All these processes need to be done
	in real-time. The main hardware components in a reference station
	module include a dual frequency GNSS receiver, a portable computation
	processor, and the communication ports. For the reference station
	module we use a module computer with Microsoft Windows XP operating
	system as the platform, and this system can be reproduced quickly
	and easily with a flexible architecture. For the master station we
	use a similar architecture with a higher performance CPU and a larger
	data storage drive. After the development of this GNSS augmentation
	system evaluation module is completed, we will place this module
	at some airports in Taiwan to evaluate the enhancement of the GNSS
	services provided by this module. We will compare this GNSS regional
	evaluation module with the APEC GNSS test bed, and we will also show
	the GNSS performance comparison between this module and the MSAS
	in Taiwan.},

	However, they have traditionally been viewed as mutually exclusive

	In this paper we show that, far from being incompatible, agile development
	and software reuse can be made to work together and, in fact, complement
	each other. The key is to tightly integrate reuse into the test-driven
	development cycles of agile methods and to use test cases - the agile
	measure of semantic acceptability - to influence the component search
	process. In this paper we discuss the issues involved in doing this
	in association with Extreme Programming, the most widely known agile
	development method, and Extreme Harvesting, a prototype technique
	for the test-driven harvesting of components from the Web. When combined
	in the appropriate way we believe they provide a good foundation
	for the fledgling concept of agile reuse. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin

	evidence for improving the quality of a planned software process
	that is followed by an organization in the future. The recovered
	process model (or patterns) is presented at the same level of abstraction
	as the planned process model. This allows an easy and clear method
	to identify the distance between a planned process model and the
	actual project enactment. We investigate the enactment of a defined

	for process model improvement from the viewpoint of the project managers
	in the context of a small software development organization. We collected
	data from one of our collaboration organizations and then applied
	our method to a case study. The consistencies between a planned process
	model and the project enactment were measured. The outcomes of our

  abstract = {Measurement of software size from user requirements is crucial for
	the estimation of the developmental time and effort. COSMIC, an ISO/IEC
	international standard for functional size measurement, provides
	an objective method of measuring the functional size of the software
	from user requirements. COSMIC requires the user requirements to
	be written at a level of granularity, where interactions between
	the internal and the external environments to the system are visible
	to the human measurer, in a form similar to use case descriptions.
	On the other hand, requirements during an agile software development
	iteration are written in a less formal way than use case descriptions
	- often in the form of user stories, for example, keeping with the
	goal of delivering a planned release as quickly as possible. Therefore,
	size measurement in agile processes uses methods (e.g. story-points,
	smart estimation) that strictly depend on the subjective judgment
	of the experts, and avoid using objective measurement methods like
	COSMIC. In this paper, we presented an innovative concept showing
	that using a supervised text mining approach, COSMIC functional size
	can be automatically approximated from informally written textual
	requirements, demonstrating its applicability in popular agile software
	development processes, such as Scrum. Â© 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

	We study methods to statistically generalize new heuristics learned
	for some small subsets of a problem space (using methods such as
	genetics-based learning) to unlearned problem subdomains. Our method
	uses a new statistical metric called probability of win. By assessing
	the performance of heuristics in a range-independent and distribution-independent
	manner, we can compare heuristics across problem subdomains in a
	consistent manner. To illustrate our approach, we show experimental
	results on generalizing heuristics learned for sequential circuit
	testing, VLSI cell placement and routing, and branch-and-bound search.
	We show that generalization can lead to new and robust heuristics
	that perform better than the original heuristics across problem instances
	of different characteristics.},

	is defined as minimizing the time between the production of intermediate
	deliverables and the validation of those deliverables. The major
	distinguishing feature of this metric is that it is independent of
	any particular software development process model, such as agile
	software development methods or the waterfall model. Therefore, this
	metric can be used for software development organizations that have
	a wide variety of software development projects with varying kinds
	of development processes. This metric has been shown to be practical
	in large software development organizations through exhaustive use
	in more than 7,000 projects over the last 9 years. Â© 2009 IEEE.},

	high quality products at minimal lead-times. The proposed method
	is based on the principles of Group Technology (GT), and on the definition
	of the neighborhood of similarity of critical design attributes.
	A two-step procedure is proposed: (1) A search procedure, which acquires
	and processes the designer's search intent to retrieve similar parts.
	(2) A sorting procedure, which ranks these parts in order of their
	similarity to the candidate part. Both procedures are based on GT
	codes, while the second can employ more detailed critical design
	information. This information is assumed available in the product
	databases of distributed partners, and can be generated via an existing
	GT design processor. The approach employs a systematic procedure
	to combine independent similarity indexes to a unique measure for
	sorting. A software system using object oriented technology has been
	developed to implement the procedure.},

	is exacerbated by a basic incompatibility between the buyer's linear

	outcomes, including budget and schedule blowouts, typically result
	in these situations. This paper proposes an agile procurement process
	that can operate in conjunction with an agile software development
	methodology to improve many aspects of software project delivery.
	This process is supported by a mechanism designed to give the buyer

	know Software Metrics as a very good approach to measure Software
	Quality. Combining both there is a promising approach to control
	and ensure the internal Software Quality. This paper introduces the
	3C Approach, which is an extension to the Agile Practice Continuous
	Integration: It adds Continuous Measurement and Continuous Improvement
	as subsequent Activities to CI and establishes Metric-based Quality-Gates
	for an Agile Quality Assurance. It was developed and proven in an
	Agile Maintenance and Evolution project for the Automotive Industry
	at T-Systems International - a large German ICT company. Within the
	project the approach was used for a (legacy) Java-based Web Application
	including the use of Open Source Tools from the Java Eco-System.

  abstract = {This paper comprehends our work on assessing the feasibility of utilizing
	different NoSQL databases in handling a huge tree data structure
	with heterogeneous nodes in which heterogeneity implies that each
	node can embody a unique attribute set. It is a prominent requirement
	arising in structured log analysis where constituents in a software
	log file are scrutinized hierarchically. Traditional pills from relational
	databases fail in handling this efficiently. We lean towards NoSQL
	paradigm, which has been emerging as a prominent solution for dealing
	with high volumes of data with localized characteristics. Our exploration
	probes five different NoSQL models: wide column store, document store,
	tuple store, graph databases and multi-model databases that collectively
	account for a large fraction of the entire NoSQL spectrum. An experiment
	is designed to measure database performance against a generic tree
	API focusing on node insertion, node query and attribute-value query.
	The API is then implemented in a database selected from each of the
	five NoSQL models in concern. Implementations are used for testing
	the database performance with respect to the three operations by
	measuring time taken for a batch of similar operations in a machine
	with average hardware and software configuration. A summary of experiment
	results is provided along with the details on tree implementation
	methodology in each database. A discussion that highlights the congruence
	between observed performance differences among databases and the
	theoretical NoSQL models they represent is also included. Â© 2012

	of parameters such as exhaust flow temperature, exhaust flow rate,
	and supplemental fuel amount on diesel aftertreatment devices. A
	heated flow-bench system was utilized in combination with a diesel
	lean NOx trap (LNT) and/or a diesel particulate filter (DPF). The
	heated flow bench had the capability of producing stable gas temperatures
	and pressure drop across these aftertreatment devices. Preliminary
	pressure drop diagnostics were conducted with unloaded substrates
	meant for LNT and DPF applications. Subsequently, the DPF was loaded
	with varying amounts of liquid water or liquid diesel fuel and pressure
	drop diagnostic tests were repeated to determine if the presence
	of liquid substances within the substrate could be detected. With
	the presence of a liquid substance, the DPF exhibited relatively
	flat and undetectable pressure drop variation up to a critical loading
	level. Once this level was reached, there was a sharp and sudden
	increase in pressure drop. Further tests investigated the effects
	of exhaust flow rate and supplemental fuel amount on raising the
	LNT substrate temperature as required for the LNT de-NOx regeneration
	process. The results suggested that the maximum substrate temperature
	was primarily dependant on the fuel amount. Although the exhaust
	flow rate had very little effect on the substrate's maximum temperature,
	it was significant in determining how quickly the maximum temperature
	was reached. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an integrated computer simulator tool of rotary crane
	with ship behavior in consideration of ship sway and load sway is
	newly built to systemize the state analysis of a shipboard crane.
	The integrated simulator of shipboard crane was realized by cooperating
	a component of external force interface routine and fluid analysis
	software. A transfer control system is conducted by HSA (Hybrid Shape
	Approach) using STT (Straight Transfer Transformation) method and
	its effectiveness in suppressing the sway of both ship and load was
	confirmed by the simulation analysis. A shipboard crane operational
	training system which we call virtual coach teaching system, is also
	presented, in order to shorten the training period of amateur operators.
	The controlled inputs generated from HSA controller which are utilized
	as the ideal commands are then converted to drive a newly built teaching
	interface. Subjects are physically coached through the ideal motion
	of joystick by placing their hand on the teaching interface, thus
	giving them a kinesthetic understanding on how to transfer a load
	without exciting the sway of both the ship and load. Performance
	of subjects was measured in terms of transfer time by conducting
	an experiment using a newly built virtual driving simulator. Findings
	from this study indicate that virtual coach teaching is effective

  abstract = {The needs for rapid software release to the market are increasing.
	We notice the limitation for sequential software development like
	Waterfall, because it takes too much time to see the moving software
	and get feedback. We are thinking to transform and adopt iterative
	development like Agile. However, there are two major issues on iterative
	development. First, the process structure is not be defined, so that
	we can't verify if the software was made in the right way. Secondary,
	the software quality is evaluated in the acceptance testing by matching
	the user requirements, so that we can't confirm software quality
	from the objective viewpoint using metrics but only from the subjective
	one. These two issues are obstacles to transform to iterative development
	from traditional one. In this presentaion, we defined software development
	process and propose quality metrics evaluation scheme in iterative
	methodology. First, we categorize the iterative development into
	two types, pure-iterative and hybrid. Then, important four parameters,
	such as the sprint term, the release term, integration type and development
	type are detected to define the process structure. Typical metrics
	for sequential development can be used in iterative development.
	But, the metrics in the iteration process must be re-evaluated, because
	the code is not stable during the iteration process due to refactoring,
	requirement evolution and so on. So we proposed the metrics re-evaluation
	scheme. We also provide the example software's result that includes
	process structure, re-evaluated quality metrics, quality control
	chart and fault convergence. By the way, we still have a couple of
	concerns. Obtaining metrics causes the extra work for programmers,
	so it is trade-off of agility. Our assumption for fault convergence
	is seems to be justified in our example software, but, we have to
	collect more example and brush up our assumption. In the future,
	we have to examine more examples to justify the quality of software
	iteratively developed only by defining process structure, without
	obtaining metrics. Â© 2012 IEEE.},

	must first answer some tough questions: How and where do we start?
	What tools should we use to define, measure, analyze, improve, and
	then control our hard won improvements? We had the opportunity to
	introduce and effect some commonly used industrial/process engineering
	tools in a 113-bed, acute-care, hospital emergency department located
	in central Texas. In an effort to become more efficient, effective,
	and adaptable at meeting community and business needs, the hospital
	has agreed to allow their Emergency Department (ED) to be the focus
	of a Six Sigma/Lean Process Improvement and Computer Simulation study.
	The goal of the project is to use Six Sigma methodology - specifically
	the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) improvement
	format - to reengineer key processes within the emergency department.
	Furthermore, the hospital wished to address the dissatisfaction of
	patients who encounter long waiting times in the ED process. Concurrently,
	the hospital would like to address the frequency and sources of mistakes;
	and improve upon the general quality level of care given to their
	customers. The efficacy of the improvements would be measured by
	the extent to which the Six Sigma methodology helped to improve the
	quality of care while reducing patients' length of stay (LOS) and
	process errors. At this point in the study, the work has progressed
	through the Define, Measure, and Analyze stages in the Six Sigma
	methodology. The key process inputs identified as "process improvement
	targets" are as follows - equipment and supplies, diagnostic results,
	the patient chart, materials, personnel, and doctor communication.
	Currently, the study is progressing into the Six Sigma Improvement
	stage. The simulation aspect of the study utilizes ProModel's MedModel
	software and is in the "as-is" model building stage.},

	introduce the concept of the Responsibility, Authority, and Accountability
	(RAA) network. An RAA network assists in the governance process of
	product lines for internal information systems, even in the face
	of massive reorganization. Armour ("Reorg Cycle" [1]) describes the
	pressures of reorganization to balance the "dimensions of organization"
	(e.g., geography, customers, product technology); we apply polarity
	management to balance the dimensions. Armour describes the difficulty
	of applying hierarchical organization charts-"single dimension management
	structures"-to the above multidimensional environments; we apply
	lean RAA networks to span organization charts and provide the multidimensional
	view needed for product lines. Armour observes that network organization
	approaches "do not have a good track record"; our experience is that
	lean, resilient RAA networks document the product line's governance
	architecture. These governance architecture patterns are applied
	repeatedly to the strata of products in the product line. We present
	the governance architect's RAA to define, monitor, and sustain governance
	health using these tools: polarity maps, polarity networks, RAA maps,
	and RAA networks. Â© Springer-Verlag 2004.},

  abstract = {Integrating human-computer interaction (HCI) activities in software
	engineering (SE) processes is an often-expressed desire. Two metrics
	to demonstrate the impact of integrating HCI activities in SE processes
	are proposed. Usability Goals Achievement Metric (UGAM) is a product
	metric that measures the extent to which the design of a product
	achieves its user-experience goals. Index of Integration (IoI) is
	a process metric that measures the extent of integration of the HCI
	activities in the SE process. Both the metrics have an organizational
	perspective and can be applied to a wide range of products and projects.
	An attempt has been made to keep the metrics easy to use in the industrial
	context. While the two metrics were proposed mainly to establish
	a correlation between the two and thereby demonstrate the effectiveness
	of integration of HCI in SE processes, several other applications
	seem likely. The two metrics were evaluated in three independent
	studies: a classroom-based evaluation with two groups of students,
	a qualitative feedback from three industry projects, and a quantitative
	evaluation using 61 industry projects. The metrics were found to
	be useful, easy to use, and helpful in making the process more systematic.
	Our studies showed that the two metrics correlate well with each
	other and that IoI is a good predictor of UGAM. Regression analysis
	showed that IoI has a somewhat greater effect on UGAM in projects
	that use the agile process model than the waterfall process and in
	the projects that are executed as a contracted software development
	service than in the projects in product companies. UGAM also correlated
	well with the traditional usability evaluations. Â© 2010 Elsevier

  abstract = {While commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) operating systems (OS) have
	long been widely used, the issue regarding their robustness is far
	from being solved. Although many efforts have been made in this research
	domain, people still find it difficult to make choices among various
	OSs for robustness concerns. This paper proposes a reference model
	for OS robustness forecast and selection that aims to forecast the
	robustness of specific OSs under given operational profiles. At the
	same time, the model can select appropriate OSs as development/operating
	platforms that meet the particular robustness requirements of the
	target workloads. Our model combines OSs' overall robustness with
	operational profiles and uses extensive tests on OS APIs to make
	our calculation. We have measured 255 APIs and CLibrary functions
	on Windows XP and Vista, and 197 CLibrary functions on Linux 2.6.22
	(Ubuntu 7.10). Our results show that on average Windows XP and Vista
	are more robust than Linux, but their performances are comparable
	under compute-intensive workloads. A demonstration of how these results
	are used in the proposed reference model for OSs robustness forecast
	and selection is given at the end. Â© 2008 IEEE.},

	The focus of such solutions is mostly on improving the synchronization
	performance. However, in most test and measurement systems, the main
	problem is not synchronization of clocks, but triggering of devices:
	even on a general purpose OS like Windows XP® it is always possible
	to find a clock source with a sufficient resolution of around 1 μs
	for a SW-only IEEE 1588 implementation, but none of the built-in
	timers is suitable for triggering the device with such a resolution.
	In this paper, we will discuss the limits of timers under Windows
	XP® and introduce an FPGA based timing HW as assistance for an IEEE
	1588 SW implementation for use in Rohde&Schwarz FSL spectrum analyzers.

	two contrasting approaches. Risk management follows a heavyweight
	management approach whereas agile process models advocate a lightweight
	engineering one. Despite this, a merge between those two is possible.
	This chapter suggests a Risk-Driven Development model (RDD), a model
	integrating risk management with agile development process models.
	It first identifies commonalities in these two process models. It
	then investigates the state of practice of integrating risk management
	with software development in 37 software organizations. The results
	of these two steps provide feedback for outlining the RDD model.
	The RDD model itself was evaluated by 10 software practitioners.

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a software cost estimation model for agile
	development which can help estimate concrete development costs for
	the desired features of a product and track the project progress
	dynamically. In general, existing cost estimation methods for agile
	developments used a story point. Because it is relative value, the
	estimation results tend to be easily fluctuated by the small variation
	of the baseline story point. For tracking project's progress, the
	velocity was measured to check the progress and was used to make
	plan for the iteration and the releases of the project. The proposed
	method in this paper provides the systematic estimation and dynamic
	tracking methodology for agile projects. To estimate the effort of
	a project development, function points are used in addition to the
	story point. The function points are determined based on the user
	stories of desired features of the product. We adopt the Kalman filter
	algorithm for tracking project progress. The remaining function points
	at a certain point during the project are modeled as the state space
	model for the Kalman filter. The daily variation of the function
	point is observed and inputted to the Kalman Filter for providing
	concrete estimation and velocity. Moreover we validate the better
	performance of our model by comparing with traditional methods through
	a case study. Â© 2010 IEEE.},

	and adherence to a particular software engineering methodology (XP).
	A variety of research methods were employed including ethnographic
	methods, questionnaires and interviews. An online personality test
	based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) was used to ascertain
	the personality types, and questionnaires were used throughout the
	project to measure levels of cohesiveness. Examples of how the teams
	worked together throughout the project are described, and whether
	and how this relates to the personality types of the individual members.
	The results indicate that certain teams were found to work consistently
	well over the project due to homogeneity in personality type and
	others were found to be very cohesive due to a mixture of types.},

  abstract = {One of the key measures of the resilience of a project is its ability
	to reach completion on time and on budget, regardless of the turbulent
	and uncertain environment it may operate within. Cost estimation
	and tracking are therefore paramount when developing a system. Cost
	estimation has long been a difficult task in systems development,
	and although much research has focused on traditional methods, little
	is known about estimation in the agile method arena. This is ironic
	given that the reduction of cost and development time is the driving
	force behind the emergence of the agile method paradigm. This study
	investigates the applicability of current estimation techniques to
	more agile development approaches by focusing on four case studies
	of agile method use across different organisations. The study revealed
	that estimation inaccuracy was a less frequent occurrence for these
	companies. The frequency with which estimates are required on agile
	projects, typically at the beginning of each iteration, meant that
	the companies found estimation easier than when traditional approaches
	were used. The main estimation techniques used were expert knowledge
	and analogy to past projects. A number of recommendations can be
	drawn from the research: estimation models are not a necessary component
	of the process; fixed price budgets can prove beneficial for both
	developers and customers; and experience and past project data should
	be documented and used to aid the estimation of subsequent projects.},

  abstract = {Research on knowledge management (KM) readiness has matured. However,
	recent organizational structures have emerged which prevent traditional
	instruments from adequately measuring KM readiness in an organization.
	For example, service-oriented enterprise (SOE) structure and agile
	software development techniques are characterized by multiple groups
	working together with each performing "services" as part of project
	pattern or process. Each group acts in its own role as a sub-organization
	with its unique helping patterns and cultures [17]. Traditional instruments
	which measure aggregate constructs across the entire organization
	will miss important between-group differences in an SOE that might
	influence KM readiness. This paper presents a case-based field-study
	from a large Fortune 500 financial firm transitioning its structure
	to SOE and considering agile software development methodologies.
	Survey data was collected along with a series of interviews with
	key managers and developers. Findings indicate statistically significant
	differences in KM readiness between groups and the need for alignment.

	factor is CMM certification. CMM is a well recognized and globally

	Pakistani software firms (SMEs) are striving to achieve the CMM certifications

	is not easy to adopt for all level of firms. Pakistan software industry
	is at its initial stage, so it is not recommendable to jump for CMM
	by software firms (SMEs) directly. The present research paper suggests
	that these software firms (SMEs) should go for adaptation of agile
	development methodology for excellent performance on the foot steps
	of CMM. In this way, software firms (SMEs) can leads toward CMM after
	agile maturity. The authors used the eXtreme Programming (XP) as
	an example that proves Agile Development Methodology can well fit
	the CMM framework and software development firms (SMEs) can achieve
	their objectives to participate in offshore outsourcing phenonmena.

  abstract = {Due to the complexity and size of embedded software together with
	strong demands on time-to-market and quality, testing is a crucial
	point that should be addressed during software development. Traditionally,
	testing is carried out during the last phases of the software development
	life cycle. As a consequence, testing activities are often subject
	to high time pressure, which either results in delayed market introduction
	or low product quality. The validation of functional and real-time
	requirements of embedded systems is a difficult task. It usually
	needs the electronic control unit and the controlled hardware components.
	But very often the hardware components are not available for testing
	the control software at the beginning of the development. In this
	paper, we paper presents how test cases can be designed from use
	cases and how embedded control software can be validated without
	hardware components by simulating the test cases in early development
	phases using the AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming). For achieving
	an aspect oriented testable format, extended UML sequence diagrams
	are applied to formalize sequences of events, which have been specified
	in the use case scenarios. Provided that black box aspect oriented
	is used for developing embedded component applications, the monitoring
	of the dynamic behavior inside the components is not possible during
	simulation. But the simulated dynamic behavior is observable on the
	connections between the software components. In such a way monitored
	and recorded time stamp events are finally compared offline against
	the expected sequences of events specified in the test cases. The
	offline comparison validates the simulated behavior by demonstrating
	the fulfillment of user requirements and by detecting errors in case
	of contradictions during modeling. Â© 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin

  abstract = {Attackers and defenders of computer systems both strive to gain complete
	control over the system. To maximize their control, both attackers
	and defenders have migrated to low-level, operating system code.
	In this paper, we assume the perspective of the attacker, who is
	trying to run malicious software and avoid detection. By assuming
	this perspective, we hope to help defenders understand and defend
	against the threat posed by a new class of rootkits. We evaluate
	a new type of malicious software that gains qualitatively more control
	over a system. This new type of malware, which we call a virtual-machine
	based rootkit (VMBR), installs a virtual-machine monitor underneath
	an existing operating system and hoists the original operating system
	into a virtual machine. Virtual-machine based rootkits are hard to
	detect and remove because their state cannot be accessed by software
	running in the target system. Further, VMBRs support general-purpose
	malicious services by allowing such services to run in a separate
	operating system that is protected from the target system. We evaluate
	this new threat by implementing two proof-of-concept VMBRs. We use
	our proof-of-concept VMBRs to subvert Windows XP and Linux target
	systems, and we implement four example malicious services using the
	VMBR platform. Last, we use what we learn from our proof-of-concept
	VMBRs to explore ways to defend against this new threat. We discuss
	possible ways to detect and prevent VMBRs, and we implement a defense
	strategy suitable for protecting systems against this threat. ©

	of improvement activities in software development. Traditionally,
	a set of well-defined metrics built up a sound foundation for measuring
	the effects on business improvements before and afterwards. However,
	those metrics are not always equally applicable throughout all development
	methodologies, especially when moving from traditional (waterfall)
	towards agile development. Furthermore, some major impacts of improvement
	activities (e.g. customer satisfaction) might not be directly accessible
	with standard measurements. For this reason we suggest that opinion
	polls should supplement traditional metrics. Opinion polls fit perfectly
	into the idea of frequent feedback, given by customers as well as
	team members, that is an inherent part of agile processes. Thus,
	opinion polls are especially suitable for agile improvements. Adding
	subjectivity and the power of individual evaluation to objective
	metrics can help to analyze root causes that form the major levers
	for achieving business impact. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

	and, as a consequence, test-driven development has become more prevalent
	in practice. However, test cases are not sufficient for producing
	dependable software and we rather advocate approaches that emphasize
	the use of assertions or contracts over that of test cases. Yet,
	writing self-checks in code has been shown to be difficult and is
	itself prone to errors. A standard technique to specify runtime properties
	is design-by-contract (DbC). But how can one test if the contracts
	themselves are sensible and sufficient? We propose a measure to quantify
	the goodness of contracts (or assertions in a broader sense). We
	introduce meta-mutations at the source code level to simulate common
	programmer errors that the self-checks are supposed to detect. We
	then use random mutation testing to determine a lower and upper bound
	on the detectable mutations and compare these bounds with the number
	of mutants detected by the contracts. Contracts are considered "good"
	if they detect a certain percentage of the detectable mutations.We
	have evaluated our tools on Java classes with contracts specified
	using the Java Modeling Language (JML). We have additionally tested
	the contract quality of 19 implementations, written independently
	by students, based on the same specification. Â© 2009 IEEE.},

	is kept low by efficiently utilising the two hard-wired PowerPC processor
	cores inside the FPGA while avoiding the use of resource-intense
	bus structures. Specific lean input/output modules are used with
	the one processor core while the other implements a Xilinx UltraController-II

  abstract = {Many software-development organizations have recently started to adopt
	agile practices in order to benefit from the improvements they clearly
	bring, in terms of production speed and software quality, for example.
	However, in a large, distributed organization, such as Nokia Siemens
	Networks, an agile transformation may be a long-term, complex process,
	and therefore, evaluating the benefits achieved, and measuring the
	success of the change, can be difficult, especially in the early
	phases of the transformation. This paper is based on the results
	of a case study on the impact introducing agile practices actually
	had in a large, software-development organization, part of Nokia
	Siemens Networks. The impact of this agile transformation was evaluated
	in terms of how well it succeeded in achieving the goals set by the
	management before the transformation started. This longitudinal study
	included two separate analyses, made at 6 monthly intervals, which
	measured what agile practices were really in use in the organization,
	and what effects, if any, were visible in terms of the goals which
	had been set by the management The 6 monthly analyses included defect
	data metrics and opinion surveys of the personnel directly involved
	in the transformation. The study showed two things: firstly, that
	the introduction of agile practices does have the beneficial effects
	that one would expect, and secondly, that, using this kind of study,
	it is not only possible to evaluate the impact that the adoption
	of agile practices has in a large, established software-development
	company, but also that the effects are visible at a surprisingly
	early stage. Â© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have repeatedly found that smaller modules are proportionally
	more defect-prone. In this article, the authors formulate and test
	a hypothesis stating that smaller modules are proportionally more
	coupled, given that dependencies caused by coupling have been consistently
	associated with defect-proneness. Strong evidence supports this hypothesis.
	Furthermore, refactoring exacerbates this effect. On the basis of
	this study's highly consistent results, the authors state the empirically
	based theory of relative dependency. That is, in large-scale software
	systems, smaller modules will be proportionally more dependent compared
	to larger ones. These findings have two implications for practice.
	First, we now have an empirically supported mechanism explaining
	the observations that defect concentration is higher in smaller modules.
	Practitioners can use this mechanism as evidence while seeking resources
	and support to revise or amend their organizations' quality assurance
	and quality control practices. Second, particularly for the projects
	that refactor extensively, such as those using agile methods, focusing
	defect detection activities on smaller modules will increase their
	efficiency and effectiveness even more. Â© 2010 IEEE.},

	between them. The technical properties of SOA and its capabilities
	depends substantially also on the way the SOA is designed and developed.
	It is whether the design and development are the top-down or the
	bottom-up ones. It, in turn, depends on the fact whether agility
	of implemented business processes and partly the agility of system
	development are required and how open the resulting system should
	be. The need for agile business processes induces the use of coarse-grained

  abstract = {A package has been developed for calculating analytic expressions
	for forces and torques onto an arbitrarily shaped convex tracer (aerosol)
	particle small compared to the mean free path of the surrounding
	nonequilibrium gas. The package Phoretic allows to compute analytical
	(and also numerical) expressions for forces and torques stemming
	from elastic and diffusive scattering processes parameterized by
	an accommodation coefficient. The method is based on calculating
	half-sphere integral tensors of arbitrary rank and on integrating
	forces and torques acting on surface elements. The surrounding gas
	is completely specified by an arbitrarily shaped velocity distribution
	function. Accordingly, Phoretic requires two inputs: A particle (surface)
	geometry and a velocity distribution function. For example, the particle
	may be a cylinder with flat end caps, and the distribution function
	the one of Maxwell (isotropic) or Grad (13th moment approximation).
	The package reproduces analytic results for spheres which were available
	in the literature, and the ones for other geometries (cylinders,
	cuboids, ellipsoids) which were, however, only partially available
	(some works considered only elastic collisions, others temperature,
	or pressure, or only velocity gradients, etc.). In addition, Phoretic
	takes into account angular velocities which have been usually neglected
	and become relevant for non-spherical particles. The package is geared
	towards the implementation of dynamical equations for aerosol particles
	suspended in dilute or semidilute gases and as such helps to obtain
	concentration profiles and mobilities of aerosol particles depending
	on their shape (distribution) and environmental conditions. Program

	i.e. field variables, and field gradients such as temperature, pressure,
	or velocity field, the problem is to analytically calculate forces
	and torques acting onto arbitrarily shaped convex tracer (aerosol)
	particles small in size compared to the mean free path of the gas.
	The collision process is modeled as a superposition of elastic and
	diffusive scattering processes (parameterized by 0 â‰¤ Î± â‰¤
	1). Method of solution: We implemented the solution to this problem
	in the symbolic programming language Mathematica Â®. The program
	allows to specify an arbitrary shape of the tracer particle and an
	arbitrary distribution function of the gas and returns symbolic or
	numerical expressions for forces and torques. The solution requires
	the calculation of half-sphere and base surface integrals and subsequent
	symbolic algebraic and tensorial manipulations. Restrictions on the
	complexity of the problem: Not known. In case the software cannot
	calculate surface integrals analytically it offers the possibility
	to proceed with a numerical evaluation of the corresponding terms.
	Typical running time: Typical running times mostly depend on the
	shape of the tracer particle. For all examples coming together with
	the software distribution run times are below 5 minutes on a modern
	single-processor platform. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	system of the VR-1 training reactor at Czech Technical University
	in Prague. The reactor was put into operation in the 1990. The original
	reactor I&C seemed to be obsolete and their replacement was being
	carried out. The new reactor I&C consists of a protection system,
	a control system and a human-machine interface. The protection system
	contains the operational power measuring (OPM) and the independent
	power protection (IPP) systems The OPM is a full power range system.
	The IPP system works in the two highest power range decades. The
	computers of both systems calculate the reactor power and power rate,
	compare them with the safety limits, and if they are exceeded, the
	safety action is initiated. The OPM and IPP systems are diverse -
	different types and location of chambers, completely different hardware,
	software algorithms, development tools and teems for the software
	manufacturing. The control system is based on a high quality industrial
	PC mounted in a 19â€³ crate. The operating system of the PC is
	the Microsoft Windows XP with the real time support RTX of the VentureCom
	Company. The human-machine interface was designed with respect to
	functional, ergonomic and aesthetic requirements. Czech and English
	interface versions are available. The I&C upgrade was carried out
	in gradual stages, it started in 2001 and successfully finished in
	2007. The new I&C improves the nuclear safety and operability of
	the reactor, and enable a prolongation of its functionality and maintainability
	for at least next 10 years.},

  abstract = {Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a relatively new process developed
	in the early 90's by The Welding Institute (TWI) of the United Kingdom.
	A rotating tool with a specific geometry is used to heat the materials
	to be joined. The heat softened material of the abutting materials
	is entrained and transfered around the tool, where it is deposited
	prior to recoalescence, thereafter forming a joint. The FSW process
	requires advanced automation to ensure consistent and reliable joints.
	This has been realized by the development of an experimental set-up
	by the integration and on-line monitoring of accurate sensors with
	reliable modular control software. With increasing productivity and
	quality requirements imposed by manufacturers, machine flexibility
	and scalability are becoming increasingly pertinent. On-line process
	monitoring facilitates the 'adaption' of machines able to respond
	to changing process parameters and conditions. Modular open software
	architectures allow flexibility in machine application. This paper
	introduces a fresh approach for the integration of the latest automation
	technology into an experimental setup equipped with an advanced sensory
	system. A new method of capturing sensory data and the implementation
	aspects of the software architecture for a micro-kernel based real-time
	embedded operating system is introduced. Agile automation of the
	FSW process is thus realized by advanced monitoring and control.},

  abstract = {Agile developers are generally reluctant to non-agile practices. Promoted
	by senior software practitioners, agile methods were intended to
	avoid traditional engineering practices and rather focus on delivering
	working software as quickly as possible. Thus, the unique measure
	in Scrum, a well known framework for managing agile projects, is
	velocity. Its main purpose is to demonstrate the progress in delivering
	working software. In software engineering (SE), measurement programs
	have more in depth purposes and allow teams and individuals to improve
	their development process along with providing better product quality
	and control over the project. This paper will describe the experience
	and the approach used in an agile SE company to design and initiate
	a measurement program taking into account the specificities of their
	agile environment, principles and values. The lessons learned after
	five months of investigation are twofold. The first one shows how
	agile teams, in comparison to traditional teams, have different needs
	when trying to establish a measurement program. The second confirms
	that agile teams, as many other groups of workers, are reluctant
	and resistant to change. Finally, the preliminary results show that
	agile people are more interested in value delivery, technical debt,
	and multiple aspects related to team dynamics and will cooperate
	to the collection of data as soon as there tools can do it for them.
	It is believed that this research could suggest new guidelines for
	elaborating specific measurement programs in other agile environments.

	Industry Solutions Unit (ISU) of TCS, this is achieved by identifying
	various Opportunities for Improvements (OFI) through idea generation.
	These OFIs are then translated into improvements projects, which
	are measured for effectiveness and implemented across the ISU. In
	the current mentor model of the improvement team, these projects
	are mentored by Six Sigma Master Black Belts (MBBs). However, there
	were just two Six Sigma Master Black Belt mentors in the process
	improvement team, leading to bandwidth constraints as the improvement
	project count increased. The team size of dedicated mentors needed
	to be ramped up to cope up with the growing number of improvement
	projects. Adequately staffing these positions with knowledgeable
	employees involves cost and continues to be a big challenge for any
	organisation The proposed model helps in development of more mentors

	Six Sigma and Change Acceleration Process. Through the proposed model,
	they are made capable to mentor various improvement projects, help

  abstract = {DDoS flooding attacks are quite popular with hackers and they can
	cause devastating impact on computer systems. Smurf attack is a type
	of flooding attack that involves ICMP protocol, which is known to
	have brought down high profile commercial websites. A computer system
	running Microsoft's Windows-XP with Service Pack2 (SP2) security
	software is designed to drop ICMP packets by default, which makes
	one believe that ICMP-based flooding attacks cannot harm a computer
	system that deploys SP2 security software. In this experimental paper,
	we set out to test and measure the effectiveness of the Microsoft
	Windows-XP with SP2 security software in protecting a computer system
	from ICMP-based flooding attacks in fast Ethernet environment. We
	simulate Smurf attacks on a computer system in the controlled lab
	environment. In these experiments, we measure the exhaustion of computing
	resource of a computer system with and without Windows-XP SP2 security
	software. It is observed that under Smurf attack, the victim computer
	deploying SP2 security software dropped all ICMP messages; nevertheless,
	the exhaustion of the processor resource of the computer running
	the SP2 security-software couldn't be stopped. Furthermore, it was
	found interestingly that the exhaustion of the processor resource
	of the computer system running the SP2 security was much higher than
	that of the computer system that didn't deploy SP2 security software.
	These experiments show that dropping of ICMP messages by SP2-security
	software at the victim computer is too late of an act in preventing
	the adverse effect of the Smurf attack. Once the attack traffic reaches
	the victim computer, SP2 security software is ineffective in preventing
	the resource exhaustion caused by the attack, even if it is configured
	to drop the ICMP messages. © 2006 IEEE.},

	down a computer system connected to Internet. There has been an increased
	targeting of Windows end-users and servers. The attackers and intruders
	are leveraging easily identifiable network blocks to target and exploit
	Windows end-user servers and computer systems. In order to provide
	some level of security and protection against security attacks, the
	Microsoft's Windows XP operating systems were designed with an additional
	level of security. The initial Microsoft's windows XP without service
	pack2 (SP2) provided windows firewall with some security features.
	The later version of Microsoft's windows XP with SP2 intends to provide
	enhanced security features to prevent and mitigate the adverse effect
	of security attacks on the host computer systems. In this experimental
	paper, we set out to conduct real TCP-SYN attacks on computer systems
	in a controlled lab environment and measure the effectiveness of
	Microsoft's windows XP without SP2, and with SP2 in preventing TCP-SYN
	attacks. The Windows firewall (without SP2) was found to be not effective
	against the TCP-SYN attacks. However, the later version of Microsoft's
	Windows XP with SP2 was found to significantly help mitigate the
	adverse effect of the TCP SYN attacks on Windows based computer systems.

	to use agility in the software development process. A recently published
	scheme by one of the authors to use the fuzzy inference system for
	agility metrics, using the parameter Project Velocity as a measure
	of agility, had encouraging results. Project velocity is dependent
	on various parameters that are fuzzy variables. The domain and dependence
	of these fuzzy variables can be represented through membership functions
	and rules. The simulations carried out using Fuzzy Logic Tool Box
	of MATLAB showed that project velocity and its dependent variables
	give a good measure of agility. This paper describes the architecture
	and implementation aspects of software, so as to estimate the agility
	of a software process using fuzzy techniques. The fuzzy if-then rules
	and coefficient are represented in the form of matrix, and the implementation

	than one person, especially in medium to large software projects.
	Each activity of software development is carried out by various combination
	of different individual. Collaboration occurs in every phase of the
	process software development. The right team collaboration method
	is one of the important things in success software development. This
	research is focused to develop collaboration model of software development
	to meet time schedule, budget, scope, and software quality.The collaboration
	model of software development is generated from survey of collaboration
	method (about face to face and virtual collaboration) and software
	development methodology especially agile methodology. The direct
	collaboration was used in the software specification processes, and
	combination (with a direct and virtual) collaboration was used during
	software design, implementation, and validation. Team coordination
	in every process of software development was done with face to face
	method. The same artifacts were used in this collaboration model
	with some collaboration software tools. Combination between face
	to face and virtual communication was used in this model. The model
	is implemented in small case software development project. During
	the software development, some measurement is carried out. The measurement
	included the measurement of project completion time, cost, software
	specification, and software quality. The software is developed in
	time schedule (two months), cost under budged, and meet specification.
	In addition, the software has built a fairly good quality. Thus,
	this collaboration model good use in software development to achieved
	accuracy of schedule, cost, scope, and quality. Â© 2011 IEEE.},

	to quantitatively analyze vertical and horizontal spray images and
	to develop correlations of atomizer performances with engine (or
	rig) test data. Applications of this facility for a dual-orifice
	atomizer with an air shroud, a piloted airblast atomizer, and an
	assembly of a Lean-Direct Injection (LDI) atomizer with premixed
	swirlers are presented. The results indicate that, to have good correlations
	of atomizer performance with engine (or rig) test data, atomizers
	must be tested under high-pressure conditions and characterized three-dimensionally.

	State of the art of research on agile and reconfigurable filters,
	passive as well as active, necessary for transceivers is then made
	and various tables for comparison are given. In the third part, a
	new theory for a 2nd-order frequency-agile filter is introduced.
	The center frequency of the filter is proportional to the gain of
	a feedback amplifier and thus can be tuned over a wide frequency
	range. This new theory is thereafter generalized to the nth-class
	leading to a center frequency proportional to (A)n/2 . Simulation
	results of band pass agile filters in current mode and made from
	second-generation current controlled conveyors (CCCII+) in 0.25 Î¼
	m SiGe BiCMOS technology are given for n =1 and n =2. These simulation
	results along with results of measurements carried out on the fabricated
	filters entirely confirm the new approach. They also highlight the
	improvements to be expected for cognitive and encrypted communications.

  abstract = {With the recent emergence of agile software development technologies,
	the software community is awaiting sound, empirical investigation
	of the impacts of agile practices in a live setting. One means of
	conducting such research is through industrial case studies. There
	are a number of influencing factors that contribute to the success
	of such a case study. In this paper, we describe a case study performed
	at Sabre Airline Solutions TM evaluating the effects of adopting
	Extreme Programming (XP) practices with a team that had characteristically
	plan-driven risk factors. We compare the team's business-related
	results (productivity and quality) to two published sources of industry
	averages. Our case study found that the Sabre team yielded above-average
	post-release quality and average to above-average productivity. We
	discuss our experience in conducting this case study, including specifics
	of how data was collected, the rationale behind our process of data
	collection, and what obstacles were encountered during the case study.
	We identify four factors that potentially impact the outcome of industrial
	case studies: availability of data, tool support, cooperative personnel
	and project status. Recognizing and planning for these factors is
	essential to conducting industrial case studies. Â© 2006 Elsevier

	The hierarchical FDD method consisting of three layered software

	and Supervisory FDD (SFDD). Whereas the DFDD is based on modular
	characteristics of sensors, actuators, and controllers connected
	or embedded to a single DSP, the CFDD is to analyze the performance
	of vehicle control system and/or compare information between different
	DSPs or connected modules. The SFDD is designed to monitor the performance
	of UGV and compare it with local goal transmitted from a ground station
	via wireless communications. Then, all software agents for DFDD,
	CFDD, and SFDD interact with each other to detect a fault and diagnose
	its characteristics. Finally, the proposed method will be validated

  abstract = {In software development, it is important to mediate various concerns
	coming from user experience (UX) designers and application developers.
	In Agile User-Centered Design (Agile-UCD), there is a special role
	called specialist who is dedicated to implement application features
	as well as to monitor user experiences. However, the specialist normally
	has difficulty in linking user tasks to be accessed via a user interface
	(UI) into application feature entities. In addition, the specialist
	may also have some unsettled usability risks that might result in
	the failure of meeting certain usability criteria and passing acceptance
	tests. To alleviate these difficulties of the specialists in Agile-UCD,
	we propose a usability-pattern-based requirement-analysis method.
	This method uses standardized and common representations of requirements
	specification to bridge the gap between user tasks and related application
	features of a UI. It also provides a guideline to allow the specialist
	to reduce usability risks in an early stage by reflecting usability
	factors of UI design patterns to an application design. A case study
	has been conducted to show how users can effectively specify user
	tasks and application features on UI workflows. It also shows how
	easy and practical it is to understand the common representations
	as well as to apply to usability patterns. Â© 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Global and lean supply chains subject manufacturers to sudden disruptions
	of different severity that affect shops floors and performance. Due
	to a variety of factors, disruptions do not only occur internally
	but also externally. Hence, if manufacturers want to ensure competitive
	performance in a highly dynamic environment, they have to be capable
	of quickly detecting disruptions and adapting their production adequately.
	The frequent appearance of supply and production glitches, however,
	highlights the inflexibility of existing supply and production systems.
	For detecting disturbances and initiating compensation mechanisms,
	knowledge e.g. about the production system, the good to be produced
	and the supply chain play a crucial role. Knowledge-based technologies
	which rely on a formal model encapsulating knowledge about a domain
	of discourse, can be an enabler for increasing reactivity and robustness
	of future factory automation systems. In this contribution, applications
	and developments of knowledge-based technology in the domain of future
	factory automation are presented. In order to detect supply chain
	disturbances earlier and realize robust, predictive diagnostics,
	the utilization of logic-based models are investigated. To reason
	about compensation options in case of disturbances, an knowledge-based
	production order optimization realized in a Manufacturing Execution
	System (MES) is presented. These knowledge-based operation techniques
	utilize a huge amount of knowledge which have to be available. To
	bridge the gap between engineering and operation, an integrated,
	knowledge-based approach to develop flexible field-level automation
	software, gather required information from Plant Lifecycle Management
	Systems and transfer this engineering knowledge into operation will
	be presented. © 2012 IFAC.},

	As a result many product ideas are being valuated through a trial
	and error and continuous improvement process. Software will play
	an important enabler for these product definitions. This is even
	more true as the off-road industry begins to adopt the open interoperability
	standard ISOBUS (ISO 11783). A comparison between the world wide
	trend for software processes, the Capability Maturity Model (CMM)
	and what type of process would fit the off-road industry is based
	around the maturity of the new product ideas. The strong supply chain
	link between dealers and customers for off-road machines coupled
	with the emerging awareness of electronic functions and controls
	sets a basis for a specialized software development process. An important
	enabler for this 'agile' process is the re-use of code and incremental
	testing with reviews.},

  abstract = {The ROCKMAG ANALYZER is a software to determine rock magnetic parameters
	from a broad variety of rock magnetic measurements. This software
	was particularly designed to visualize and evaluate data from isothermal
	remanent magnetization acquisition, coercivity curves, hysteresis
	loops and/or thermomagnetic curves. Various standard and non-standard
	rock magnetic parameters are calculated from these curves, thus,
	accelerating and simplifying the quantitative analysis of the measured
	data. View options like plotting derivatives, para-/diamagnetic correction,
	etc. further enhance the data analysis. Procedures for smoothing
	and data fitting by mathematical functions are implemented. Isothermal
	remanent magnetization acquisition and coercivity curves can be fitted
	by log-Gaussian functions and hysteresis loops by hyperbolic basic
	functions. Curie temperature estimation from thermomagnetic curves
	is supported by two different automated approaches: a second derivative
	method and a extrapolation method. A number of additional diagrams
	provide composite plots of parameters obtained by different measurements,
	like the Day plot and the Henkel plot. The ROCKMAG ANALYZER was designed
	for the output file format of the Variable Field Translation Balance
	(MM VFTB). It also supports data from the PM VSM/AGFM. The ROCKMAG
	ANALYZER requires Win95/98/ME/2k/XP and is available at "http://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/research/paleomagnetism/".

	is how to provide an adequate but not excessive application of nutrients
	to crops to ensure food production while maintaining or improving
	environmental health. This has long been a problem in agriculture
	and is well known to be a knowledge-intensive process. The problem
	solution draws on multi-disciplinary information in several disciplines
	of agriculture and thus provides a challenge for information technology.
	A handheld decision aid program, Nutrient Management Support System
	for a Personal Digital Assistants (NuMaSS-PDA), has been developed
	to support nutrient management for PDA devices for extension officers,
	farmer leaders, and farmers in the tropics. The program inputs begin
	with diagnostic field and plant data, the various observations and
	measured data are combined in a Bayesian combination framework for
	a summary evaluation of the probability of deficiencies in nitrogen,
	phosphorus, and potassium. This diagnostic module is one of four
	that comprise the decision-aid: 1) Diagnosis, 2) Prediction, 3) Economic
	analysis and 4) A Recommendation Summary. The Economic analysis module
	will in included in future releases. Efficient use, user-friendliness,
	cost-effectiveness, local adaptability and environmental concern
	were specifications for software development. The development framework
	uses SuperWaba, a Java-like programming tool with GNU General Public
	License (GPL). This development tool facilitated the implementation
	for multiple platforms, including Palm OS and various Windows mobile
	platforms. A flexible routine that permits language versions of English,
	French, Portuguese, Tetun, and Tagalog languages has been developed
	for prototype testing. The extreme programming style was followed
	to facilitate inclusion of multiple disciplines and viewpoints in
	the software. Pilot testing of the algorithms in Thailand indicates
	that NuMaSS-PDA improves predictions of nutrient requirements.},

	coverage, and all-uses testing were compared on two bases: the number
	of seeded faults found and the number of tests needed to satisfy
	the criteria. The comparison used a collection of Java classes taken
	from various sources and hand-seeded faults. Tests were designed
	and generated mostly by hand with help from tools that compute test
	requirements and muJava. The findings are that mutation tests detected
	more faults and the other three criteria were very similar. The paper
	also presents a secondary measure, a cost benefit ratio, computed
	as the number of tests needed to detect each fault. Surprisingly,
	mutation required the fewest number of tests. The paper also discusses

  abstract = {Data warehouses (DWs) must be agile and continuously evolve to meet
	changing business needs. While change management in DW is frequently
	discussed in the literature, such discussion is usually fragmented.
	Furthermore, the traditional approach to managing changes in DW is
	primarily reactive in nature, that is, after a business change has
	already occurred, the data warehouse is updated, remodeled, and reconfigured
	to reflect such a change. While such an approach may keep the data
	warehouse relatively current, obsolesce of the data, even in terms
	of a short period of time, remains a problem, which makes decisions
	based on the DW ineffective. To make a DW more accurate, current,
	and agile, proactive strategies on the planning, design, implementation,
	and use of a DW system should be pursued to reduce future service
	disruptions due to changes. This paper proposes a proactive approach,
	in which proactive measures are employed in different system development
	life cycle (SDLC) phases of a data warehousing project to manage
	and control negative impacts of changes. The paper has also discussed
	the implications of the proactive approach and agile methodology
	on the software industry as well as on firms that use DWs.},

  abstract = {Spyware infections are becoming extremely pervasive, posing a grave
	threat to Internet users' privacy. Control of such an epidemic is
	increasingly difficult for the existing defense mechanisms, which
	in many cases rely on detection alone. In this paper, we propose
	SpyShield, a new containment technique, to add another layer of defense
	against spyware. Our technique can automatically block the visions
	of untrusted programs in the presence of sensitive information, which
	preserves users' privacy even after spyware has managed to evade
	detection. It also enables users to avoid the risks of using free
	software which could be bundled with surveillance code. As a first
	step, our design of SpyShield offers general protection against spy
	add-ons, an important type of spyware. This is achieved through enforcing
	a set of security policies to the channels an add-on can use to monitor
	its host application, such as COM interfaces and shared memory, so
	as to block unauthorized leakage of sensitive information. We prototyped
	SpyShield under Windows XP to protect Internet Explorer and also
	evaluated it using real plug-ins. Our experimental study shows that
	the technique can effectively disrupt spyware surveillance in accordance
	with security policies and introduce only a small overhead. Â©

  abstract = {We describe and evaluate two new, independently-applicable power reduction
	techniques for power management on processors that support dynamic
	voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS): user-driven frequency scaling
	(UDFS) and process-driven voltage scaling (PDVS). In PDVS, a CPU-customized
	profile is derived offline that encodes the minimum voltage needed
	to achieve stability at each combination of CPU frequency and temperature.
	On a typical processor, PDVS reduces the voltage below the worst-case
	minimum operating voltages given in datasheets. UDFS, on the other
	hand, dynamically adapts CPU frequency to the individual user and
	the workload through direct user feedback. Our UDFS algorithms dramatically
	reduce typical operating frequencies and voltages while maintaining
	performance at a satisfactory level for each user. We evaluate our
	techniques independently and together through user studies conducted
	on a Pentium M laptop running Windows applications. We measure the
	overall system power and temperature reduction achieved by our methods.
	Combining PDVS and the best UDFS scheme reduces measured system power
	by 49.9% (27.8% PDVS, 22.1% UDFS), averaged across all our users
	and applications, compared to Windows XP DVFS. The average temperature
	of the CPU is decreased by 13.2Â°C. User trace-driven simulation
	to evaluate the CPU only indicates average CPU dynamic power savings
	of 57.3% (32.4% PDVS, 24.9% UDFS), with a maximum reduction of 83.4%.
	In a multitasking environment, the same UDFS+PDVS technique reduces
	the CPU dynamic power by 75.7% on average. Â© 2009 IEEE.},

	process management is presented in this chapter. The method follows
	the guidelines suggested by extreme programming that asks less design
	work for speeding software development. Further, for effective guidance
	on the development, it directs the construction of system components
	by imposing a layered specification and construction of these components
	through its process of development activities where Petri net techniques
	and Java annotation features are imposed to support such management
	issues as SCM, traceability, and progress monitoring. Since the method
	directs a layered development of system components and the management
	of its development activities is featured in an integrated manner,
	team productivities can be greatly enhanced by intimate collaborations
	between development and management staff. For illustration, an example
	application is presented that directs the development of a software
	system with business-oriented services. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

	of various biological tissues. This paper introduces the process
	of acquiring chemical shift images of selected biological tissues
	and the determinations of imaging parameters for spectral images
	of optimum quality. An image analysis software was developed and
	image analysis algorithms such as image segmentation, pseudo-color
	processing, and image fusion were established for the analysis of
	spectral images. The software allows for displaying the acquired
	data either as a set spectrum representing the chemical composition
	of each pixel, or image slices representing the spatial distribution
	of an individual component. The efficacy of chemical shift imaging
	is demonstrated in this research with quantitative analysis of lean

	Based on the inphase and quadratic components of the input and output
	signals of a high power amplifier, a three-layer RVTDNN is firstly
	trained in Matlab and then implemented in Agitent Design System software.
	In order to speed up the training process, a second-order learning
	algorithm namely Scaled Conjugate Gradient Method (SCGM) is employed
	to extract the RVTDNN model parameters (weights and biases). The
	comparison of the simulation based results to the measured ones reveals
	the strong ability of the identified RVTDNN to accurately predict
	the dynamic nonlinear behavior of a 90-Watt LDMOS power amplifier
	under a two-carrier 3GPP-FDD excitation signal. Â© 2005 IEEE.},

	fuzziness of nonconformance information. In addition, the existing
	nonconformance tracking and recovery systems are usually special
	purpose systems. They lack the capabilities to migrate to new working
	domains and integrate with other systems. In conjunction with the
	soft computing and case-based reasoning (CBR) technologies, a generic
	intelligent system has been designed to address the nonconformance
	tracking and diagnosis problem. A system built under such a comprehensive
	approach can track the nonconformance with multiple causes as well
	as limited knowledge and provide timely diagnostic recovery. A prototype
	of the GINTR system is developed using the Microsoft .NET technology,
	which is considered as the next generation distributed computing
	paradigm. The prototype system developed is generic, fault tolerant,
	and agile. It can be adapted to diverse complex manufacturing environments
	with minimum difficulty.},

	are carried out in hard real time, for which a suitable hardware

	on H 2 and H âˆž methods, using an own procedure for controller
	auto-tuning, which is valid for SISO (scalar) and MIMO (multivariable)
	processes. The main components of the system are ControlAvH software
	and EPESC system. ControlAvH has been developed under Windows XP,
	and it makes transparent for the user the mathematical complexity
	associated with controller design, and additionally provides a friendly
	user interface which facilities monitoring, analysis and controller
	validation tasks. EPESC system hardware consists of data acquisition
	cards and PC platforms, and its software for hard real time modules
	have been developed using Linux-RTAI. The complete system (EDECOS)
	is very flexible and scalable, implementing all the stages in controller
	design, implementation and evaluation.},

	must be able to react to changes in the business model and, likewise,
	their technology platform (i.e., architecture) must be agile. Often,
	the operations and environment requirements of a system affect the
	application's ability to be modified quickly. This article presents
	a methodology that combines ISO standards and UML (Unified Modeling
	Language) standards. The ISO model is used to identify the quality
	characteristics for software architecture. These attributes form
	an evaluation framework. Each functional requirement is defined as
	a use case model using UML notation. This model is expanded with
	the specific quality properties required based on the ISO model.
	The resulting use cases are prioritized on the basis of their architectural
	impact. With these use cases, several candidate architectures can
	be identified. Alternatives are compared to the evaluation framework
	to select one architecture design. A real-time monitoring system
	is used as a case study to reinforce the methodology introduced in
	the article.},

  abstract = {A novel flame holder that makes use of a carbureted fuel injection
	system (CFIS) has recently been developed. Initial testing of the
	CFIS flame holder was performed under conditions similar to those
	present in a modern gas turbine engine thrust augmentor in order
	to determine the stability limits of the flame holder design. Six
	different fuel injection configurations were tested in an effort
	to identify the key factors contributing to stable operation. Flame
	stabilization was achieved only at lean operating conditions for
	five of the fuel injection configurations, while the use of extension
	tubes at the carburetor channel exits in the sixth configuration
	expanded the stability limits to include richer operating conditions.
	Two of the fuel injection configurations were modeled extensively
	using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. In addition, a
	Phase Doppler Particle Analysis (PDPA) was performed during the testing
	of one flame holder configuration to measure fuel droplet size emanating
	from the CFIS exits and into the wake. Stability was found to be
	highly dependent on fuel spray penetration into the main air stream
	and fuel distribution in the wake. Future efforts will focus on optimizing
	fuel placement to further improve stability limits. Copyright ©

  abstract = {Manual visual inspection is by far the most widely used weld inspection
	method. A given weld may be visually examined multiple times as parts
	are joined and made into assemblies. Because visual inspection is
	somewhat subjective, and prone to error (a typical inspector only
	identifies about 85% of the visible defects); welds that pass one
	inspection may fail subsequent inspections, resulting in multiple
	inspection and repair cycles. This paper discusses a project that
	tested the benefits and limitations of a semiautomated weld inspection
	system. The goal of this semiautomated inspection approach is to
	provide quantitative, nonsubjective quality measurements of welded
	structures in order to: eliminate redundant inspections, reduce unnecessary
	multiple repair cycles, avoid repair of welds that meet minimum size
	requirements, and enable recording of weld size so that overwelding
	can be identified and reduced. The technology would also allow tracking
	of weld quality and statistical analysis of welding process capability
	to support lean/six-sigma continuous improvement initiatives. A prototype
	system was assembled and field tested by inspecting actual ship structures.
	The equipment evaluated has potential, but needs both hardware and
	software modifications before it can be used as a tool on a regular
	basis in a shipbuilding environment. As is, it will be useful as
	an audit tool to gauge the health of the visual inspection process
	and to further document the inherent variability of the visual inspection
	process. Recommendations were made for improvements to refine the
	prototype tool prior to broader deployment.},

	design, coding and testing, has become a controversial focus of interest.
	Many researchers and practitioners remain skeptical of claims for
	the productivity of pair programming. Three controlled experiments,
	by Nosek, William, and Nawrocki, all reported statistical productivity
	measurements, but the results were inconsistent and the differences
	among the results could not be explained because there exists no

	proposes a cognitive model that describes the programming mechanism
	and this in turn can be used to explain why and when a pair may outperform
	two individuals. The model helps explain discrepancies in the results
	of the above-mentioned experiments. To show how the proposed model
	can be applied, a psychological experiment was conducted in which
	twenty-two programmers who were informed only of the experiment and
	the results of Nosek, and of the descriptions of Williams and Nawrocki,
	were able to use our model to predict the possible outcomes of the

  abstract = {Agile Software Development methodologies have grown in popularity
	both among academic researchers and industrial practitioners. Among
	the various methodologies or practices proposed, pair programming,
	which is concerned with two programmers collaborating on design,
	coding and testing, has become a controversial focus of interest.
	Even though some success stories have been reported with the use
	of pair-programming in real software development environment, many
	people remain rather skeptical of the claims on pair-programming
	productivity. Previous studies in pair programming have only addressed
	the basic understanding of the productivity of pairs and they have
	not addressed the variation in productivity between pairs of varying
	skills and experience, such as between novice-novice and expert-expert.
	Statistical productivity measurements reported by different researchers
	also seem to lead to contradictory conclusions. Until now, the literature
	has not addressed how those results and experiments were related
	to each other. In this paper, we propose a controlled experiment
	called repeat-programming which can facilitate the understanding
	of relationships between human experience and programming productivity.
	Repeat-programming can be performed when controversial issues in
	non-traditional programming methodologies and development productivity
	need to be investigated into. To illustrate how the proposed empirical
	experiment can put arguable, divisive problems into perspective,
	we have examined the productivity in pair programming as a case study.
	With repeat-programming, we are able to (i) better understand why
	results of previous pair programming control experiments reached
	different conclusions as to the productivity of pair programming
	and (ii) most importantly, present a case in which novice-novice
	pairs against novice solos are much more productive than expert-expert
	pairs against expert solos. Â© 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	present some computational models and a toolset that we designed
	to address some needs of teachers trying to make use of particular
	localized documents called "travel stories". Our research challenge
	is to enable teachers to design interaction scenarios for such a
	domain, avoiding any programmer intervention. In the design process,
	the teacher typically faces three activities: (a) Identification
	of candidate documents, (b) Evaluation of the adequacy of the document
	and (c) Production of the learning application making use of the
	selected document. In this paper, we mainly focus on the (c) Production
	activity. We highlight the necessary use of an "agile" approach to
	shorten as much as possible the delay between the design and the
	evaluation step of a prototype. To address the technological challenges
	raised by such an aim, we present WIND framework and we discuss its
	capabilities while considering some examples of interactive scenarios

  abstract = {Code coverage and mutation score measure how thoroughly tests exercise
	programs and how effective they are, respectively. The objective
	is to provide empirical evidence on the impact of pair programming
	on both, thoroughness and effectiveness of test suites, as pair programming
	is considered one of the practices that can make testing more rigorous,
	thorough and effective. A large experiment with MSc students working
	solo and in pairs was conducted. The subjects were asked to write
	unit tests using JUnit, and to follow test-driven development approach,
	as suggested by eXtreme Programming methodology. It appeared that
	branch coverage, as well as mutation score indicator (the lower bound
	on mutation score), was not significantly affected by using pair
	programming, instead of solo programming. However, slight but insignificant
	positive impact of pair programming on mutations score indicator
	was noticeable. The results do not support the positive impact of
	pair programming on testing to make it more effective and thorough.
	The generalization of the results is limited due to the fact that
	MSc students participated in the study. It is possible that the benefits
	of pair programming will exceed the results obtained in this experiment
	for larger, more complex and longer projects. Â© Springer-Verlag

	software development practices popularized by eXtreme Programming
	methodology. The aim of the practices is to improve software quality.
	Objective: Provide an empirical evidence of the Impact of both practices
	on package dependencies playing a role of package level design quality
	indicators. Method: An experiment with a hundred and eighty eight
	MSc students from Wroclaw University of Technology, who developed
	finance-accounting system in different ways (CS - classic solo, TS
	- TDD solo, CP - classic pairs, TP - TDD pairs). Results: It appeared
	that package level design quality indicators (namely package dependencies
	in an object-oriented design) were not significantly affected by
	development method. Limitations: Generalization of the results is
	limited due to the fact that MSc students participated in the study.
	Conclusions: Previous research revealed that using test-driven development
	instead of classic (test-last) testing approach had statistically
	significant positive Impact on some class level software quality
	indicators (namely CBO and RFC metrics) in case of solo programmers
	as well as pairs. Combined results suggest that the positive Impact
	of test-driven development on software quality may be limited to
	class level. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

	effectively. This may include the capability of a project to be adapted
	to the dynamism that exists in the stakeholders' needs, technological
	changes, etc. To assure such a capability, it is necessary to assess
	the extent of projects' adaptability to change. This could be done
	by expressing the agility in terms of some quantifiable parameters
	such as size of the project's organisation, levels of expertise,
	etc. However, there are uncertainties embedded in measurement of
	such parameters caused by imprecision and lack of well-defined information,
	which cannot be well treated by conventional assessment approaches.
	To address such a complexity, in this article, a decision aid model
	using fuzzy set theory is proposed for agility assessment of projects.
	The applicability of the proposed model will be demonstrated by a
	case study in software development project management.},

	with the aim of studying the behavior of development teams using
	Scrum for the first time, i.e., a situation typical for software
	companies trying to introduce Scrum into their development process.
	13 student teams were required to develop an almost real project
	strictly using Scrum. The data on project management activities were
	collected in order to measure the amount of work completed, compliance
	with the release and iteration plans, and ability of effort estimation,
	thus contributing to evidence-based assessment of the typical Scrum
	processes. It was found that the initial plans and effort estimates
	were over-optimistic, but the abilities of estimating and planning
	improved from Sprint to Sprint. Most teams were able to define almost
	accurate Sprint plans after three Sprints. In the third Sprint the
	velocity stabilized and the actual achievement almost completely
	matched the plan.},

  abstract = {The speed of today's worms demands automated detection, but the risk
	of false positives poses a difficult problem. In prior work, we proposed
	a host-based intrusion-detection system for worms that leveraged
	collaboration among peers to lower its risk of false positives, and
	we simulated this approach for a system with two peers. In this paper,
	we build upon that work and evaluate our ideas ''in the wild.'' We
	implement Wormboy 2.0, a prototype of our vision that allows us to
	quantify and compare worms' and non-worms' temporal consistency,
	similarity over time in worms' and non-worms' invocations of system
	calls. We deploy our prototype to a network of 30 hosts running Windows
	XP with Service Pack 2 to monitor and analyze 10,776 processes, inclusive
	of 511 unique non-worms (873 if we consider unique versions to be
	unique non-worms). We identify properties with which we can distinguish
	non-worms from worms 99% of the time. We find that our collaborative
	architecture, using patterns of system calls and simple heuristics,
	can detect worms running on multiple peers. And we find that collaboration
	among peers significantly reduces our probability of false positives
	because of the unlikely appearance on many peers simultaneously of
	non-worm processes with worm-like properties. Copyright 2006 ACM.},

  abstract = {This report presents some important factors related to safety-critical
	software in machinery. The following subjects are considered in the
	text, bearing in mind the subject: The role of safety-critical software
	in machinery, statistics of software faults, requirements, safety
	and security principles, risk and hazard modelling, agile development,
	safety process patterns, safety-related architectures, verification
	and validation, phases of development and formal methods. The general
	observation is that there are many methods for software design and
	it is difficult to choose the most relevant ones. The report shows
	some criteria for selecting methods and some aspects related to current
	topics. There are so many different safety-critical software applications
	in machinery that the research found the most interesting topics
	and then focused on them. The statistics show that most defects arise
	during the requirements specification and architectural design phases
	of the lifecycle. This is before any coding. The statistics also
	show that the defect density is higher in large programs, i.e. the
	number of defects increases exponentially as the program size grows.
	It may therefore be better to separate safety-critical and standard
	code in order to keep the first one small. The separation of modules
	and keeping the connections between modules under control and narrow
	is recommended in order to have advantages in testing, understanding
	of the program, limited error spreading, program development etc.
	There are many kinds of self-diagnostic and monitoring functions
	that may be complex and increase the number of defects, but they
	increase safety and are needed in safety-critical code. The standard
	IEC 61508-3, published in 2010, lays down many functional requirements
	for safetycritical programmable systems. However, there are also
	other standards related to functional safety and the safety of control
	systems. This paper also considers some aspects related to the safety
	of agile methods. The standards show the requirements related to
	the phases of the V-model, but agile methods are not considered.
	The functional safety of software is achieved through systematic
	(not intuitional) use of adequate methods in all phases of the programmable
	system lifecycle. Programmable systems contain hardware and software,
	both of which need to be considered in the validation process. Copyright

	of the fellow member are hypothesized to increase the perceived effort
	applied in software development. This relationship is moderated by
	the characteristics of the software development task. Perceived effort
	applied at the task is hypothesized to mediate the relationship between
	trust and the team performance which is measured in terms of the

	to be implemented in hours or days rather than weeks or months. Poor
	quality or late upload into the bus hardware would cause serious
	cost and overhead. Established software engineering methods were
	considered inadequate and needed to be cut short. Agile methods offer
	guidance when quality, flexibility and high speed need to be reconciled.
	However, we did not adopt any full agile method, but added single
	agile practices to our "process improvement toolbox". We suggested
	a number of classical process improvement activities (such as more
	systematic documentation and measurement) and combined them with
	agile elements (e.g. Test First Process). This combination seemed
	to foster acceptance of agile ideas and may help us to break the
	ice for a cautious extension of agile process improvement.},

  abstract = {As information technology continues to evolve, analysis of material
	presented in a curriculum requires constant monitoring. Courses in
	information technology have been in high demand in educational institutions
	nationwide. In light of these demands information systems programs
	have identified a critical need to incorporate more systems and network
	administration into their curricula. The students who are progressing
	towards a B.S. in Information Systems Technology (IST) are the primary
	audience of the course detailed in this paper. The increasing use
	of virtual technologies by companies across multiple industries has
	made it extremely important for IT programs to provide students with
	experience using virtual technologies. As the virtual technology
	market evolves, it is important to monitor and report the changes
	through course material. Due to the growth in networking and virtual
	technologies and the need for undergraduate students in non-networking
	majors to understand and learn about network protocols, network operating
	system fundamentals, network operating systems, database and web
	servers and directory services, a course for IST students was developed.
	To meet the practical objectives of the course, students require
	dedicated computers on which to install operating systems and applications.
	However, providing each lab group a dedicated machine would be space
	and cost prohibitive. By using VMware as the platform, students are
	able to gain hands-on laboratory experience that emphasizes networking
	and systems software problem solving and troubleshooting skills through
	installation and configuration of network operating systems as well
	as application software. The course laboratory activities currently
	include one-week on VMware orientation, three-weeks on Windows XP
	Pro and Windows 2003 Server, three-weeks on SQL Server 2005 and Internet
	Information Server (IIS), three-weeks on Exchange Server 2003, and
	the last five-weeks of the semester cover Linux and Apache Web Server.
	This paper will discuss the course design including lecture and laboratory
	activities, the challenges associated with the laboratory activities,
	as well as the pros and cons with using VMware. © American Society

  abstract = {Recent developments in numerical techniques and computational processing
	power now permit time-dependent, multi-dimensional computational
	fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations with reduced chemical kinetic mechanisms
	(approx. 20 species and 100 reactions). Such computations have the
	potential to be highly effective tools for designing lean-burn, high
	BMEP natural gas engines that achieve high fuel efficiency and low
	emissions. Specifically, these CFD simulations can provide the analytical
	tools required to design highly optimized natural gas engine components
	such as pistons, intake ports, precombustion chambers, fuel systems
	and ignition systems. To accurately model the transient, multi-dimensional
	chemically reacting flows present in these systems, chemical kinetic
	mechanisms are needed that accurately reproduce measured combustion
	data at high pressures and lean conditions, but are of sufficient
	size to enable reasonable computational times. Presently these CFD
	models cannot be used as accurate design tools for application in
	high BMEP lean-burn gas engines because existing detailed and reduced
	mechanisms fail to accurately reproduce experimental flame speed
	and ignition delay data for natural gas at high pressure (40 atm
	and higher) and lean (0.6 equivalence ratio (<) and lower) conditions.
	Existing methane oxidation mechanisms have typically been validated
	with experimental conditions at atmospheric and intermediate pressures
	(1 to 20 atm) and relatively rich stoichiometry. These kinetic mechanisms
	are not adequate for CFD simulation of natural gas combustion in
	which elevated pressures and very lean conditions are typical. This
	paper provides an analysis, based on experimental data, of the laminar
	flame speed computed from numerous, detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms
	for methane combustion at pressures and equivalence ratios necessary
	for accurate high BMEP, lean-burn natural gas engine modeling. A
	reduced mechanism that was shown previously to best match data at
	moderately lean and high pressure conditions was updated for the
	conditions of interest by performing sensitivity analysis using CHEMKIN.
	The reaction rate constants from the most sensitive reactions were
	appropriately adjusted in order to obtain a better agreement at high
	pressure lean conditions. An evaluation of this adjusted mechanism,
	"MD19", was performed using Converge CFD software. The results were
	compared to engine data and a remarkable improvement on combustion
	performance prediction was obtained with the MD19 mechanism. Copyright

  abstract = {The primary goal of most OSs (Operating Systems) is the efficient
	use of computer systems software and hardware resources. Since Windows
	OSs are most widely used OS for personal computers, they need to
	satisfy needs of all different kind of computer systems users. In
	comparison with Windows XP, new versions of the Windows OS; namely
	Windows Vista and Windows 7, introduce a number of new features and
	enhancements. Furthermore, performance improvement was imposed as
	one of the key design goals for both Windows Vista and Windows 7.
	This paper presents a performance evaluation of three latest versions
	of the Microsoft OS for personal computers; namely Windows XP, Windows
	Vista and Windows 7. OS performance measurement is done by means
	of a set of benchmark applications in the controlled environment.
	To ensure accurate, reliable and repeatable performance measurement
	results, we have created a performance measurement process and a
	performance evaluation model. Special emphasis is placed on evaluation
	areas with the greatest impact on the performance: CPU scheduling,
	memory management, graphic subsystem management, hard disk drive
	management and network performance. To determine the Windows OSs
	performance in different environments, performance measurement is
	done in three experiments. Experimental results indicate that Windows
	Vista and Windows 7 have several performance improvements on the
	stand-alone high-end computer system, but Windows XP outperforms
	Windows Vista and Windows 7 on the stand-alone low-end computer system.
	Furthermore, on network computer system Windows Vista and Windows
	7 show network performance improvements mostly for the traffic with
	medium-sized packets. Â© J.UCS.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we draw on control theory to understand the conditions
	under which the use of agile practices Iis most effective in improving
	software project quality. Although agile development methodologies
	offer the potential of improving software development outcomes, limited
	research has examined how project managers can structure the software
	development environment to maximize the benefits of agile methodology
	use during a project. As a result, project managers have little guidance
	on how to manage teams who are using agile methodologies. Arguing
	that the most effective control modes are those that provide teams
	with autonomy in determining the methods for achieving project objectives,
	we propose hypotheses related to the interaction between control
	modes, agile methodology use, and requirements change. We test the
	model in a field study of 862 software developers in 110 teams. The
	model explains substantial variance in four objective measures of
	project quality-bug severity, component complexity, coordinative
	complexity, and dynamic complexity. Results largely support our hypotheses,
	highlighting the interplay between project control, agile methodology
	use, and requirements change. The findings contribute to extant literature
	by integrating control theory into the growing literature on agile
	methodology use and by identifying specific contingencies affecting
	the efficacy of different control modes. We discuss the theoretical
	and practical implications of our results. Â© 2009 INFORMS.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen is considered to be the fuel of future as it's use does not
	lead to CO, CO 2 hydrocarbon (HC) emission. It can he used in existing
	internal combustion engines, yielding unprecedented efficiencies
	and extremely low levels of exhaust pollution. Hydrogen can be used
	in conjunction with compact liquid fuels such as gasoline, alcohol
	or diesel provided each is stored separately. The drawback of lean
	operation with hydrocarbon fuels is a reduced power output. Lean
	operation of hydrocarbon engines has additional drawbacks. Lean mixtures
	are hard to ignite 1. Mixing hydrogen with other hydrocarbon fuels
	reduces all these drawbacks. Hydrogen's low ignition energy limit
	and high burning speed makes the hydrogen/ hydrocarbon mixture easier
	to ignite, reducing misfire and thereby improving emissions, performance
	and fuel economy. The engine used in the present study was a Kirloskar
	AV-1, single cylinder direct injection diesel engine. Diesel was
	injected through a nozzle of hole size 0.15mm. A CNG injector (to
	inject simultaneously hydrogen directly in to the cylinder) was also
	provided. The engine was coupled to a dc dynamometer. The engine
	was modified and provision was made to vary the compression ratio
	from 14.5 to 24.5. A computer interfaced piezo sensor, of range (2000
	psi) was used to note the pressure inside the cylinder. Special software
	was used to obtain combustion parameters related with pressure inside
	the cylinder. The hydrogen gas was inducted into the intake manifold
	and a thermal mass flow controller controlled its flow rate. The
	pressure of hydrogen which was at 150 bars inside the cylinder was
	reduced to atmospheric pressure before inducting it into the manifold.
	The airflow rate was measured using a laminar flow element. The speed
	of the engine was maintained constant by controlling the hydrogen
	gas mass flow rate. Emissions were measured using an advanced AVL
	five-gas analyzer. All the tests were conducted at a constant speed
	of 1400 rev/min, at various loads rangingfrom 20% to 100% of full
	load. The injection timing of diesel was varied from 40° BTDC to
	5° ATDC. During the experiments heating the air in the intake charge
	tank varied the inlet temperature of the air. The temperature was
	measured after the hydrogen was mixed with air in the inlet manifold.},

	foreseen software architecture evolution. The selection of the optimum
	refactoring strategy can be a daunting task involving the identification
	of refactoring candidates, the determination of which refactorings
	to apply and the assessment of the refactoring impact on software
	product quality characteristics. As such, the benefits from refactorings
	are measured from the quality advancements achieved through the application
	of state of the art structural quality assessments on refactored
	code. Perceiving refactoring trough the lens of value creation, the
	optimum strategy should be the one that maximizes the endurance of
	the architecture in future imposed changes. We argue that an alternative
	measurement and examination of the refactoring success is possible,
	one, that focuses on the balance between effort spent and anticipated
	cost minimization. In this arena, traditional, quality evaluation
	methods fall short in examining the financial implications of uncertainties
	imposed by the frequent updates/modifications and by the dynamics
	of the XP programming. In this paper we apply simple Real Options
	Analysis techniques and we perceive the selection of the optimum
	refactoring strategy as an option capable of generating value (cost
	minimization) upon adoption. Doing so, we link the endurance of the
	refactored architecture to its true monetary value. To get an estimation
	of the expected cost that is needed to apply the considered refactorings
	and to the effect of applying them, in the cost of future adoptions
	we conducted a case study. The results of the case study suggest
	that every refactoring can be associated with different benefit levels

  abstract = {Efficient data processing is a long-standing challenge in remote sensing.
	Effective and efficient algorithms are required for product generation
	in ground processing systems, event-based or on-demand analysis,
	environmental monitoring, and data mining. Furthermore, the increasing
	number of survey missions and the exponentially growing data volume
	in recent years have created demand for better software reuse as
	well as an efficient use of scalable processing infrastructures.
	Solutions that address both demands simultaneously have begun to
	slowly appear, but they seldom consider the possibility to coordinate
	development and maintenance efforts across different institutions,
	community projects, and software vendors.This paper presents a new
	approach to share, reuse, and possibly standardise geoprocessing
	logic in the field of remote sensing. Drawing from the principles
	of service-oriented design and distributed processing, this paper
	introduces moving-code packages as self-describing software components
	that contain algorithmic code and machine-readable descriptions of
	the provided functionality, platform, and infrastructure, as well
	as basic information about exploitation rights. Furthermore, the
	paper presents a lean publishing mechanism by which to distribute
	these packages on the Web and to integrate them in different processing
	environments ranging from monolithic workstations to elastic computational
	environments or "clouds". The paper concludes with an outlook toward
	community repositories for reusable geoprocessing logic and their
	possible impact on data-driven science in general. Â© 2013 International

	many assessment methods are linked to plan-driven improvement models

	support these claims with statistics from the Irish software industry
	and present a lightweight assessment method called Adept. Adept unifies
	an existing plan-driven assessment method and an adapted, risk-based
	Agility/Discipline Assessment method. Adept has a low resource overhead

  abstract = {While mechanisms exist to instantiate common security functionality
	such as confidentiality and integrity, little has been done to define
	a mechanism for identification and remediation of devices engaging
	in behavior deemed inappropriate. This ability is particularly relevant
	as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of
	software-defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can
	alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set
	of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices.
	We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism
	for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed
	our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily
	be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on
	a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized
	trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information
	on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture
	of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes
	in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy
	violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible
	in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable
	devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our
	approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power
	and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating
	the system, we consider how our mechanism, 1) impacts system performance,
	2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, 3) addresses "bad mouthing"
	and 4) resists collusion. Â©2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {While mechanisms exist to instantiate common security functionality
	such as confidentiality and integrity, little has been done to define
	a mechanism for identification and remediation of devices engaging
	in behavior deemed inappropriate. This ability is particularly relevant
	as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of
	software-defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can
	alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set
	of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices.
	We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism
	for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed
	our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily
	be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on
	a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized
	trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information
	on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture
	of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes
	in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy
	violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible
	in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable
	devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our
	approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power
	and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating
	the system, we consider how our mechanism, 1) impacts system performance,
	2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, 3) addresses "bad mouthing"
	and 4) resists collusion. Â©2007 IEEE.},

	ANT build systems from two perspectives: (1) a static perspective,
	where we examine the build system specifications using software metrics
	adopted from the source code domain; and (2) a dynamic perspective
	where representative sample build runs are conducted and their output
	logs are analyzed. Case studies of four open source ANT build systems
	with a combined history of 152 releases show that not only do ANT
	build systems evolve, but also that they need to react in an agile

  abstract = {Many students begin to form their software development habits in introductory
	programming courses. Although problem-solving strategies and other
	good practices are taught at the introductory level, early experiences
	in programming tend to involve small assignments and so students
	do not always see the benefits and value of good software engineering
	practices. Consequently, they develop habits which are hard to break
	later when faced with significant problems where good practices are
	essential for success. Furthermore, students report that typical
	CS1 lab experiences tend to be unsatisfactory and even irrelevant.
	In order to give the students early meaningful experiences in developing
	good habits using a software engineering methodology which fits the
	limited time-constraints of the academic environment, eXtreme Programming
	(XP) was employed for the lab portion of a second semester CS1 course.
	This paper describes how XP practices were incorporated into a semester-long
	project where classes met once a week in a closed lab. Specific affective
	objectives were also introduced which were measured quantitatively
	and qualitatively. This paper describes our methodology, assessment,
	results, and plans for improvement. Â© Springer-Verlag 2004.},

  abstract = {The increasing span of control of Air Traffic Control enterprise automation
	(e.g. Flight Schedule Monitor, Departure Flow Management), along
	with lean-processes and pay-for-performance business models, has
	placed increased emphasis on operator training time and error rates.
	There are two traditional approaches to the design of human-computer
	interaction (HCI) to minimize training time and reduce error rates:
	(1) experimental user testing provides the most accurate assessment
	of training time and error rates, but occurs too late in the development
	cycle and is cost prohibitive, (2) manual review methods (e.g. cognitive
	walkthrough) can be used earlier in the development cycle, but suffer
	from poor accuracy and poor inter-rater reliability. Recent development
	of " affordable" human performance models provide the basis for the
	automation of task analysis and HCI design to obtain low cost, accurate,
	estimates of training time and error rates early in the development
	cycle.This paper describes a usability/HCI analysis tool that this
	intended for use by design engineers in the course of their software
	engineering duties. The tool computes estimates of trials-to-mastery
	(i.e. time to competence for training) and the probability of failure-to-complete
	for each task. The HCI required to complete a task on the automation
	under development is entered into the web-based tool via a form.
	Assessments of the salience of visual cues to prompt operator actions
	for the proposed design are used to compute training time and error
	rates. The web-based tool enables designers in multiple locations

	usage of user interfaces or Human Machine Interface (HMI) systems
	based on research being conducted at the MSI Research Institute,
	Loughborough University. In collaboration with Krause GmbH and Lamb
	Technicon UK Ltd two full size demonstrator machines have been commissioned
	to evaluate a Component Based control system and its associated design
	environment The Krause machine consists of a transport system and
	a tappet assembly station, the Lamb Technicon machine consists of
	a single station from a transfer line machine for cylinder head machining.
	The framework for HMI System's described in this paper meets the
	requirements that automated manufacturing production machines face
	from the emerging agile manufacturing paradigm. Machines must be
	able to respond quickly to continuous change by many globally distributed
	engineering partners. This facilitates visibility of the system common
	model to all the globally distributed engineering partners involved
	in a given project. Within the C-B framework, HMI systems are composed
	from instances of reusable software templates that are targeted at
	specific user types. User targeted operator interfaces offer a common
	look and feel that improves usability. The machine's configuration
	is achieved by populating a series of HMI templates to produce a
	complete machine HMI system. A thin-client architecture is used based
	on server / client internet technologies that allow the machine HMI
	to be executed on any internet enabled computer using a standard
	web browser. It is possible to drive both the real machine and a
	simulated 3D virtual machine model via the HMI, enabling engineers
	to be trained on the operation of the HMI prior to the real machine
	being completed.},

	This paper has outlined literature discussing various CMC styles

	communication style differences indicated that the current 'lean'
	text-based electronic communication systems tend to promote a more
	direct 'report' communication style. Because a learner's CMC style
	may influence or impact the recipient's view of the message and/or

	seem prudent for learners to be aware of, monitor, and perhaps strategically
	utilise their communication styles that benefit them in being more
	effective in their CMC. It is concluded that learners should be familiar

	an individuals or a teams adherence to the extreme programming (XP)
	methodology. Specifically, we hypothesize that the adherence to the
	XP methodology is not a uni-dimensional construct as presented by
	the Shodan survey but a multidimensional one reflecting dimensions
	that are theoretically grounded in the XP literature. Using data
	from software engineers in the University of Sheffields Software
	Engineering Observatory, two different models were thus tested and
	compared using confirmatory factor analysis: a uni-dimensional model
	and a four-dimensional model. We also present an exploratory analysis
	of how these four dimensions affect students grades. The results
	indicate that the four-dimensional model fits the data better than
	the uni-dimensional one. Nevertheless, the analysis also uncovered
	flaws with the Shodan survey in terms of the reliability of the different
	dimensions. The exploratory analysis revealed that some of the XP
	dimensions had linear or curvilinear relationship with grades. Through
	validating the four-dimensional model of the Shodan survey this study
	highlights how psychometric techniques can be used to develop software
	engineering metrics of fidelity to agile or other software engineering
	methods. Â© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	current trend towards customer-oriented, agile and scalable service
	provisioning. Customers' demand for highly specialized services can
	mostly not be met by a single provider that offers a holistic solution
	but by a consortium of providers that cooperate. In order to enable
	the combination of services and hence, the collaboration between
	different service providers, technical challenges like the compatibility
	of interfaces have to be dealt with. In addition, economic issues
	concerning profit, reliability and risk of service failure have to
	be taken into consideration. A model of Agreement Networks (ANs)
	is presented that illustrate the legal bindings that are established
	or under negotiation between service providers and a methodology
	is introduced that supports providers in ANs to decide on the establishment
	of a combination of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that incurs the
	lowest risk of SLA violation. Finally, a benchmark for risk-based
	decisions is derived that serves to evaluate the efficiency of the
	choice. The impact of the available amount of monitoring data on
	the decision is investigated and a minimal amount of 100 observations
	for each SLA combination is suggested.},

	the software development process itself. The underlying system, i.e.,
	the system to which the aspects are woven, is not the software product
	but the environment where it is developed. We define aspects to support
	both software process management and software process modeling. As
	we show, the aspects can monitor, enforce, or even partially implement
	compliance with desired development practices. They also provide
	a basis for a precise description of a software development process.
	As a case-study, we consider Extreme Programming (XP) and the Eclipse
	platform. XP is a software development methodology described by underlying
	values, principles and practices. We present examples of AspectJ
	aspects that support XP guidelines such as "compose tests before
	coding" or "provide rapid feedback". Their abstract definitions are
	shown to be platform independent and correspond to the XP ontology.
	Their concrete implementation and weaving is connected to Eclipse,
	an open-source development environment. The design and a prototype

	construct new knowledge by rearranging and refining their existing
	knowledge. Agile software development methods follows this approach
	of learning as software is developed in short iterations and agile
	team incorporated all new knowledge gained through feedbacks from
	preceeding iterations. Agile software development methods are different
	from traditional software development methods and therefore, metrics
	proposed for projects using traditional software development methods
	are not fit to use in agile software development projects. In this
	paper, new metrics are proposed that can measure the progress and
	quality of the product in agile software development projects. The
	proposed metrics are also compared with existing agile metrics.},

	Agile Methodologies and to a lower amount to software reengineering.
	In these communities refactoring is supposed to improve in the long-term
	the structure of existing code in order to make it easier to modify
	and maintain. To sustain such claims and analyze the impact of refactoring
	on maintenance we need to know how much refactoring developers do.
	In few cases such information is directly available for example from
	CVS log messages. In this study we propose a model on how to mine
	software repositories in order to obtain information of refactoring
	effort throughout the evolution of a software system. Moreover, we
	have developed a prototype that implements our model and validate
	our approach with two small case studies. Â© 2008 Springer-Verlag

	important to meet different and changing customer needs and heterogeneous
	system environments. Efficient software customization processes with
	short lead times are thus a priority for companies to stay competitive.
	The purpose of this case study is to identify waste-related problems
	in a software product customization process by using value stream
	maps (VSM). The study was conducted at the telecom company Ericsson
	AB; the empirical data was collected using document analysis, extraction
	of phase times from a requirements tracking tool and interviews.
	It was used to construct a value stream map that showed the present
	state of the process. The map was then used in interviews with key
	stakeholders where they identified waste and proposed measures to
	avoid them. These solution proposals were subsequently used to construct
	a future value stream map showing a reduced lead time. Static validation
	showed that the VSM methodology was useful and that the identified
	solutions were of value. Our results have applicability for software
	engineering process improvement in general and for customization
	processes in particular. Â© 2010 IEEE.},

	radio. We proposed a hierarchical modem architecture and a tree bus
	structure based on the time constraint and complexity in the signal
	processing in software-defined radio. We divided the functions based
	on the proposed architecture with the Third Generation Partnership
	Project Direct Sequence-Frequency Partition Duplex (3GPP DS-FDD)
	mode as the evaluation motive and evaluated the processing load and
	the flexibility. Next, we developed an evaluation board loaded with
	a CPU and a programmable logic device (PLD) and measured the scale
	of the proposed architecture and the overhead due to data transfers.
	On the evaluation board, the proposed architecture was implemented
	with 551 kGates and 5.1-Mbit circuit scale, excluding the CPU core
	and the transmission hardware (Tx-HW). We verified the overhead of
	each processor due to data transfers to be about 2.5% of the total
	processing load. Thus, this architecture achieved a lower frequency
	for the CPU operating clock and a simpler process flow, and demonstrated
	the ability to construct an efficient software-defined radio. Â©

	and compared to the target sources generated by source mask optimization
	software or targets of traditional sources. Comparison between measured

	model and by simulated imaging impact. Also the first results in

	to assess the product play a key role in influencing the quality.
	Recent results show that the popularity of the agile processes like
	XP is growing. Since XP is people-oriented (unlike other software
	development methods that are either process or product-oriented)
	there is a sudden surge in the confidence levels of customers and
	programmers. Our contributions in this paper are: (1) To identify
	the extremes to which methods like XP can go to handle the testing
	phases. Testing starts early in XP projects. Design, implementation
	and testing all happen together under incremental development. (2)
	To systematically analyse how the testing practices help specifically
	to improve the product quality. (3) To identify software product
	quality assessment methods in XP projects and relate product quality
	factors to product quality metrics with respect to XP practices.
	Through our approach we investigate the benefits of XP methodology
	and its capacity to deliver high quality software through its testing
	practices especially in small-scale software companies.},

	results in better risk assessment, on time delivery and optimal use

	extremely difficult to assess in short time periods. We have designed

	factors affecting software development of the project. We used Bayesian
	networks (BNs) as an approach that gives such an estimation. We present
	a quantitative model for project health evaluation that helps decision
	makers make the right decision early to amend any discrepancy that

  abstract = {Solid organ transplant has been steadily increasing in number both
	nationally and internationally. Caring for the transplant patients
	in the hospital setting, right after the patient is moved from the
	intensive care unit to the ward, is one of the most challenging tasks
	in nursing. It involves many procedures, rigid protocols, tight monitoring,
	and intensive data gathering for use by the other coordinating healthcare
	professionals. The complexity is further increased when a nurse has
	to take care of several transplant patients in a single shift. Of
	late, there has been a growth of computer applications in nursing
	and clinical information systems. Their acceptability and usability
	determine the ultimate success of computer support for this complex
	task. In this paper, we present a case study in which we combine
	two well-known software engineering techniques-namely, agile programming
	and user centered design-toward the goal of developing an interactive
	system for supporting the activities of transplant nurses in a hospital
	setting. This has resulted in a usable end-product and the user centered
	approach has motivated the nurses to move towards the use of computers
	in their jobs for better productivity. The product's usability was
	formally evaluated and is reported herein. The strengths and limitations

	to fulfil the needs of using high resolution data, large swath width
	and frequent revisit time from satellite remote sensing to monitor
	and support the exploitation of resources for various applications
	such as cartography, agriculture, forestry, etc. The aim of this
	paper is to present the THEOS system, its mission & image performances,
	and ground segment data processing. THEOS satellite is a compact
	and agile satellite with two push-broom scanning optical instruments,
	providing worldwide imagery in Panchromatic and Multispectral modes,
	covering the Visible and Near Infrared spectrum. The Panchromatic
	instrument has a resolution of 2 metres and a swath width of 22 kilometres.
	The Multispectral instrument has a resolution of 15 metres and a
	swath width of 90 kilometres. Foreseen performances, geometrical
	image quality (Ground Sampling Distance, Modulation Transfer Function,â‹¯)
	and radiometric image quality (Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Compression,â‹¯)
	will be presented with their associated on ground processing (e.g.
	resampling, deconvolution, denoising). Data downlinked from the instrument
	will be transmitted to THEOS IGS (Image Ground Segment), on-ground
	data processing. The role of THEOS IGS is to provide standard and
	value added products from THEOS images corresponding to end users'
	needs. Its hardware and software enable the automatic processing
	of the transmitted image telemetry up to level 2A. The working stations
	of the Image Exploitation Facility provide high level tools to generate
	value added and precision products.},

	custom analyses. Agile software assessment entails gathering and
	exploiting the broader context of software information related to
	the system at hand as well as the ecosystem of related projects,
	and beyond to include "big software data". Finally, informed decision
	making entails continuous assessment by monitoring the evolving system

  abstract = {Background: Protein-amide proton hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX)
	is used to investigate protein conformation, conformational changes
	and surface binding sites for other molecules. To our knowledge,
	software tools to automate data processing and analysis from sample
	fractionating (LC-MALDI) mass-spectrometry-based HDX workflows are
	not publicly available. Results: An integrated data pipeline (Solvent
	Explorer/TOF2H) has been developed for the processing of LC-MALDI-derived
	HDX data. Based on an experiment-wide template, and taking an ab
	initio approach to chromatographic and spectral peak finding, initial
	data processing is based on accurate mass-matching to fully deisotoped
	peaklists accommodating, in MS/MS-confirmed peptide library searches,
	ambiguous mass-hits to non-target proteins. Isotope-shift re-interrogation
	of library search results allows quick assessment of the extent of
	deuteration from peaklist data alone. During raw spectrum editing,
	each spectral segment is validated in real time, consistent with
	the manageable spectral numbers resulting from LC-MALDI experiments.
	A semi-automated spectral-segment editor includes a semi-automated
	or automated assessment of the quality of all spectral segments as
	they are pooled across an XIC peak for summing, centroid mass determination,
	building of rates plots on-the-fly, and automated back exchange correction.
	The resulting deuterium uptake rates plots from various experiments
	can be averaged, subtracted, re-scaled, error-barred, and/or scatter-plotted
	from individual spectral segment centroids, compared to solvent exposure
	and hydrogen bonding predictions and receive a color suggestion for
	3D visualization. This software lends itself to a "divorced" HDX
	approach in which MS/MS-confirmed peptide libraries are built via
	nano or standard ESI without source modification, and HDX is performed
	via LC-MALDI using a standard MALDI-TOF. The complete TOF2H package
	includes additional (eg LC analysis) modules. Conclusion: "TOF2H"
	provides a comprehensive HDX data analysis package that has accelerated
	the processing of LC-MALDI-based HDX data in the authors' lab from
	weeks to hours. It runs in a standard MS Windows (XP or Vista) environment,
	and can be downloaded http://tof2h.bio.uci.edu or obtained from the
	authors at no cost. Â© 2008 Nikamanon et al; licensee BioMed Central

  abstract = {Aspect-oriented reengineering aims to modularize crosscutting concerns
	in an existing system using a new abstraction called an aspect. Code
	concerns may be tangled and scattered throughout an existing code
	base thus hampering maintenance. This paper describes the reengineering
	of an object-oriented software library called GEF using aspect-oriented
	techniques as an integral activity in an agile process. Graph Editing
	Framework (GEF) is a medium-sized open source Java library for the
	construction of graph editing applications. We evaluated both the
	original and reengineered code by applying a set of appropriate software
	metrics to measure to what extent aspect-oriented refactoring affected
	modularity attributes such as coupling, cohesion and complexity.
	To mirror a real world setting, analysis, redesign, and semi-automated
	refactoring was performed in three-week iterations typical of agile
	development using tools freely available on the Eclipse platform.
	We found that only marginal improvements in modularity were possible
	in that timeframe and argue that fully-automated aspect mining and
	refactoring tools are needed to bolster aspect-oriented reengineering.},

  abstract = {Address resolution protocol (ARP) is widely used to maintain mapping
	between data link (e.g. MAC) and network (e.g. IP) layer addresses.
	Although most hosts rely on automated and dynamic management of ARP
	cache entries, current implementation is well-known to be vulnerable
	to spoofing or denial of service (DoS) attacks. There are many tools
	that exploit vulnerabilities of ARP protocols, and past proposals
	to address the weaknesses of the 'original' ARP design have been
	unsatisfactory. Suggestions that ARP protocol definition be modified
	would cause serious and unacceptable compatibility problems. Other
	proposals require customised hardware be installed to monitor malicious
	ARP traffic, and many organisations cannot afford such cost. This
	study demonstrates that one can effectively eliminate most threats
	caused by the ARP vulnerabilities by installing anti-ARP spoofing
	agent (ASA), which intercepts unauthenticated exchange of ARP packets
	and blocks potentially insecure communications. The proposed approach
	requires neither modification of kernel ARP software nor installation
	of traffic monitors. Agent uses user datagram protocol (UDP) packets
	to enable networking among hosts in a transparent and secure manner.
	The authors implemented agent software on Windows XP and conducted
	an experiment. The results showed that ARP hacking tools could not
	penetrate hosts protected by ASA. Â© 2012 The Institution of Engineering

  abstract = {Empirical validation of software metrics suites to predict fault proneness
	in object-oriented (OO) components is essential to ensure their practical
	use in industrial settings. In this paper, we empirically validate
	three OO metrics suites for their ability to predict software quality
	in terms of fault-proneness: the Chidamber and Kemerer (CK) metrics,
	Abreu's Metrics for Object-Oriented Design (MOOD), and Bansiya and
	Davis' Quality Metrics for Object-Oriented Design (QMOOD). Some CK
	class metrics have previously been shown to be good predictors of
	initial OO software quality. However, the other two suites have not
	been heavily validated except by their original proposers. Here,
	we explore the ability of these three metrics suites to predict fault-prone
	classes using defect data for six versions of Rhino, an open-source
	implementation of JavaScript written in Java. We conclude that the
	CK and QMOOD suites contain similar components and produce statistical
	models that are effective in detecting error-prone classes. We also
	conclude that the class components in the MOOD metrics suite are
	not good class fault-proneness predictors. Analyzing multivariate
	binary logistic regression models across six Rhino versions indicates
	these models may be useful in assessing quality in OO classes produced
	using modern highly iterative or agile software development processes.

  abstract = {Assessing progress and stability in rapid, highly iterative and agile
	object-oriented software development processes is difficult because
	program evolution appears somewhat disorderly. With agile software
	development methods, the expected time to reach software stability
	is obscured by the dynamic nature of the agile process itself. The
	System Design Instability (SDI) metric was developed to help analyze
	object-oriented software evolution under these conditions. In this
	paper we examine a new version of SDI, called SDI e, based on the
	maximum entropy in a system. We believe our new measure is easier
	to calculate than the original version of SDI since it is based on
	data that are more commonly available than those used by SDI; also,
	SDIe gives a more accurate indication of software stability and maturity
	since it suffers less from data spikes. To validate the new metric,
	we use maintenance data from a commercial software project, developed
	using an agile process; these are the same data that were collected
	and analyzed in the original SDI study. In addition, we apply the
	refined SDI metric to the evolution of a well-established, open-source,
	iteratively-developed software product The results of our case study
	indicate our new SDIe metric is a viable measure of system design
	stability. Copyright Â© 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Empirical studies have shown complexity metrics to be good predictors
	of testing effort and maintainability in traditional, imperative
	programming languages. Empirical validation studies have also shown
	that complexity is a good predictor of initial quality and reliability
	in object-oriented (OO) software. To date, one of the most empirically
	validated OO complexity metrics is the Chidamber and Kemerer Weighted
	Methods in a Class (WMC). However, there are many more OO complexity
	metrics whose predictive power has not been as extensively explored.
	In this study, we explore the predictive ability of several complexity-related
	metrics for OO software that have not been heavily validated. We
	do this by exploring their ability to measure quality in an evolutionary
	software process, by correlating these metrics to defect data for
	six versions of Rhino, an open-source implementation of JavaScript
	written in Java. Using statistical techniques such as Spearman's
	correlation, principal component analysis, binary logistic regression
	models and their respective validations, we show that some lesser
	known complexity metrics including Michura et al.'s standard deviation
	method complexity and Etzkorn et al.'s average method complexity
	are more consistent predictors of OO quality than any variant of
	the Chidamber and Kemerer WMC metric. We also show that these metrics
	are useful in identifying fault-prone classes in software developed
	using highly iterative or agile software development processes. Copyright

	defined radios (SASDR) will be equipped with advanced radio frequency
	(RF) sensors that will enable them to sense their environment and
	adaptively select the best and most stable portions of the spectrum
	to establish communications. This paper presents a robust method
	for estimating locally the unused or underutilized regions of RF
	spectrum to optimize dynamic spectrum usage. These adaptive algorithms
	are described and results of "Open Spectrum" estimation performed
	on real RF spectrum measurements illustrate the robust performance
	of the approach. Simulation results are shown along with results
	from real measurements that describe the RF resources in rural, suburban
	and urban areas in and around Philadelphia in the VHF and UHF bands.
	The measurements represent a good dynamic data set including motion
	and spatio-temporal diversity. The effect on reducing the risk of
	interference by collaborating across multiple nodes that provides
	increased robustness of sensing of open spectrum through spatial
	diversity is also discussed and quantitative values for the interference
	mitigation under collaborative behaviors are also presented. © 2005

	and form part of the implicit rationale on which design and implementation
	decisions are based. These assumptions can fail at any time, with
	serious consequences. This paper presents a lightweight approach
	to assumption management (AM) designed to suit agile development.
	Assumptions were monitored for three months within a small agile
	team. Two key indicators were proposed for measuring AM success but
	only one was detected in the research results. A number of strong
	correlations were found between properties of assumptions. Data collection
	largely depended on the subjective judgements of the first author,
	but they were validated with some success by his colleagues. In some
	ways, assumption management was found to complement agile development.
	However, AM was not fully integrated into the team's development
	process, due to difficulty in adopting an 'assumption-aware' way
	of thinking. Suggestions are offered on how this transition may be
	eased, and on how others might wish to build on this research. Â©

  abstract = {The article is focused on research management and cooperation within
	the research team and between the research team and enterprise (industrial
	or commercial) partners. It is a kind of meta-research (research
	on a research method). Roots of some problems of the current scientific
	research can be seen in a lot of isolation that still endures - both
	personal isolation of the individual scientists, and isolation of
	the academic world from the industrial/commercial one and vice versa
	that makes the scientific research applied practically impossible
	-, and in bad time and/or resource management. A lot of research
	activities are conducted by researchers itself who are excellent
	professionals in the area of investigation, however the communication
	skills or leadership is often lacking. It makes conducting research
	as cooperation of a team at least inefficient or unmanageable. The
	article focuses on Scrum method that is popular as a product oriented
	management method in software development. It comments Scrum - strictly
	team based activity, rigid but informal - as suitable candidate for
	management of some types of scientific research. A special attention
	is devoted to the aspect of iterative incremental deliveries that
	enable an operative planning of suitable ratio between scientific
	and practical tasks for each iteration (usually from 2 to 4 weeks)
	allowing monitoring and controlling milestones, industrial or commercial
	needs together with actual state of the research. A positive side
	effect is that the potentially idle workers can share task of the
	'opposite world', and thus the experience of the scientist can be
	enriched by the real industrial task cognition, and vice versa. The
	paper describes a Scrum implementation in the scientific research,
	and shows some practical findings. A community web site www.scruminresearch.org
	loosely grouping people and teams applying Scrum in research is proposed
	as a conclusion. Such web site can help with sharing information,
	tips and tricks and could allow collaboration of research teams on
	tuning Scrum in research. Â© 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Auditory artifacts due to switching head-related transfer functions
	(HRTFs) are investigated, using a software-implemente dynamic virtual
	auditory display (DVAD) developed by the authors. The DVAD responds
	to a listener's head rotation using a head-tracking device and switching
	HRTFs to present a highly realistic 3D virtual auditory space to
	the listener. The DVAD operates on Windows XP and does not require
	high-performance computers.A total system latency (TSL), which is
	the delay between head motion and the corresponding change of the
	ear input signal, is a significant factor of DVADs. The measuredTSL
	of our DVAD is about 50 ms, which is sufficient for practical applications
	and localization experiments .Another matter of concern is the auditory
	artifact in DVADs caused by switching HRTFs. Switching HRTFs gives
	rise to wave discontinuity of synthesized binaural signals, which
	can be perceived as click noises that degrade the quality of presented
	sound image. A subjective test and excitation patterns( EPNs) analysis
	using an auditory filter are performed with various source signals
	and HRTF spatial resolutions. The results of the subjective test
	reveal that click noise perception depends on the source signal and
	the HRTF spatial resolution. Furthermore , EPN analysis reveals that
	switching HRTFs significantly distorts the EPNs at the off signal
	frequencies. Such distortions, however, are masked perceptually by
	broad-bandwidth source signals, whereas they are not masked by narrowbandwidth
	source signals, there by making the click noise more detectable.
	A higher HRTF spatial resolution leads to smaller distortions. But,depending
	on the source signal, perceivable clicknoises still remain even with
	0.5-degrees patial resolution, which is less than minimum audible
	angle( 1 degree in front). Â© 2008 The Institute of Electronics,

	are being favoured over the highly formalised approaches of the past.
	Likewise, access control may benefit from a less prescriptive approach
	with an increasing reliance on users to behave ethically. These ideals
	correlate with optimistic access controls. However, ensuring that
	users behave in a trustworthy manner may require more than optimistic
	access controls. This paper investigates the possibility of enhancing
	optimistic access controls with usage control to ensure that users
	conduct themselves in a trustworthy manner. Usage control enables
	finer-grained control over the usage of digital objects than do traditional
	access control policies and models. Further to ease the development
	and maintenance of usage control measures, it is posited that it
	is completely separated from the application logic by using aspect-oriented
	programming. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	problems. This paper describes investigative work undertaken in order
	to evaluate the mobile code abstractions of Mobile Agents and Mobile
	Objects, and to understand the implications of using these abstractions
	to build distributed systems. We describe two systems built to support
	the Sales Order Process of a distributed manufacturing enterprise,
	using IBM's Aglets Software Development Kit. The Sales Order Process
	model and the requirements for agility used as the basis for these
	implementations are derived from data collected in an industrial
	case study. Both systems are evaluated using the Goal/Question/Metric
	methodology. Two new metrics for Semantic Alignment and Change Capability
	are presented and used to evaluate each system with respect to the
	degree of system agility supported. The systems are evaluated through
	a set of scenarios generated during the case study in an attempt
	to see if they support system integration and agility in the manufacturing
	domain. Further we examine the implications of using a mobile code
	abstraction when compared with the abstraction offered by traditional
	distribution technology. The work described provides evidence that
	both Mobile Agent and Mobile Object systems have inherent properties
	that can be used to build agile distributed systems. Further, Mobile
	Agents with their additional autonomy provide marginally greater
	support.},

	to the story cards like requirements conflicts, missing requirements,
	ambiguous requirements, define standard structure of story cards,
	to address non-functional requirements from exploration phase, and
	the use of a simplified and tailored assessment method for story
	cards based requirements engineering practices based on the CMM,
	which is poorly addressed at CMM. CMM does not cover how the quality
	of the requirements engineering process should be secured or what
	activities should be present for the requirements engineering process
	to achieve a certain maturity level. It is difficult to know what
	is not addressed or what could be done to improve the process. We
	also presents how can be the identified areas of improvement from
	assessment can be mapped with best knowledge based story cards practices
	for agile software development environments.},

	focused on moving these vulnerable security tools into an isolated
	virtual machine, this approach cripples security tools by preventing
	them from doing active monitoring. This paper describes an architecture
	that takes a hybrid approach, giving security tools the ability to
	do active monitoring while still benefiting from the increased security
	of an isolated virtual machine. We discuss the architecture and a
	prototype implementation that can process hooks from a virtual machine
	running Windows XP on Xen. We conclude with a security analysis and
	show the performance of a single hook to be 28 μsecs in the best

	demand novel approaches to attitude control and dynamics. The paradigm
	of ever stiffer, ever more massive designs is likely to give way
	to active, passive, and/or hybrid active/passive structural control
	of payloads with soft, well-damped bus-to-payload interfaces. Agility,
	often achieved through the use of control-moment gyros (CMGs), can
	also benefit from the highly damped, readily predictable dynamics
	characteristic of this new paradigm. Honeywell is developing a spacecraft
	attitude-dynamics testbed that is designed to assist in research,
	demonstration, and validation of hardware and software architectures
	for such spacecraft. The testbed offers high-agility slew and scan
	capability (via six CMGs) with structural control (via active vibration-isolation
	and payloadsteering platforms and discrete high-performance structural
	dampers). The combination of a line-of-sight metrology system capable
	of sub-microradian resolution and a large range-of-motion spherical
	airbearing offers a unique environment for testing innovative controls
	and dynamics concepts in spacecraft design.},

	tracking a feature point in 2D image sequences in this paper. The
	proposed strategy greatly extends Matthews et al's template tracking
	strategy [I. Matthews, T. Ishikawa and S. Baker, The template update
	problem, IEEE Trans. PAMI 26 (2004) 810-815.] by incorporating a
	robust non-rigid image registration step used in medical imaging.
	Matthews et al's strategy uses the first template to correct drifts
	in the current template; however, the drift would still build up
	if the first template becomes quite different from the current one
	as the tracking continues. In our strategy the first template is
	updated timely when it is quite different from the current one, and
	henceforth the updated first template can be used to correct template
	drifts in subsequent frames. The method based on the proposed strategy
	yields sub-pixel accuracy tracking results measured by the commercial
	software REALVIZÂ® MatchMoverÂ® Pro 4.0. Our method runs fast
	on a desktop PC (3.0 GHz PentiumÂ® IV CPU, 1GB RAM, WindowsÂ®
	XP professional operating system, Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Â® programming),
	using about 0.03 seconds on average to track the feature point in
	a frame (under the assumption of a general affine transformation
	model, 61Ã—61 pixels in template size) and when required, less
	than 0.1 seconds to update the first template. We also propose the
	architecture for implementing our strategy in parallel. Â© 2009

	proposed suite of SOC-specific coupling metrics and software maintainability
	in terms of the specific subcharacteristics of analyzability, changeability,
	and stability. The results indicate a statistically significant causal
	relationship between the investigated coupling metrics and the maintainability
	of service-oriented software. As such, the investigated metrics can
	facilitate coupling related design decisions with the aim of producing

	as businesses become more agile and underlying processes and rules
	change more frequently. However, to date, the impact of service cohesion
	on the analyzability subcharacteristic of maintainability has not
	been rigorously studied. Consequently, this paper extends existing
	notions of cohesion in the Procedural and OO paradigms in order to
	account for the unique characteristics of SOC, thereby supporting
	the derivation of design-level software metrics for objectively quantifying
	the degree of service cohesion. The metrics are theoretically validated,
	and an initial empirical evaluation using a small-scale controlled
	study suggests that the proposed metrics could help predict analyzability
	early in the Software Development Life Cycle. If future industrial
	studies confirm these findings, the practical applicability of such
	metrics is to support the development of service-oriented systems
	that can be analyzed, and thus maintained, more easily. In addition,
	such metrics could help identify design problems in existing systems.

	distributed environments must rely extensively on mediated interactions.
	Practicing agile principles in distributed environments therefore
	poses particular control challenges related to balancing fixed vs.
	evolving quality requirements and people vs. process-based collaboration.
	To investigate these challenges, we conducted an in-depth case study
	of a successful agile distributed software project with participants
	from a Russian firm and a Danish firm. Applying Kirsch's elements
	of control framework, we offer an analysis of how control was enacted
	through the project context and in the participants' mediated communication.
	The analysis reveals that formal measurement and evaluation control
	were persistently enacted through mediated communication. These formal
	control practices were, however, predominantly carried out in conjunction
	with informal roles and relationships such as clan-like control inherent
	in agile development. Overall, the study demonstrates that, if appropriately
	applied, communication technologies can significantly support distributed,
	agile practices by allowing concurrent enactment of both formal and
	informal controls. The paper discusses these findings as they relate
	to previous research and concludes with their implications for future

  abstract = {Responsiveness to customer needs is an important goal in agile and
	lean software development. One major aspect is to have a continuous
	and smooth flow that quickly delivers value to the customer. In this
	paper we apply cumulative flow diagrams to visualize the flow of
	lean software development. The main contribution is the definition
	of novel measures connected to the diagrams to achieve the following
	goals: (1) increase throughput and reduce lead-time to achieve high
	responsiveness to customers' needs and (2) to provide a tracking
	system that shows the progress/status of software product development.
	An evaluation of the measures in an industrial case study showed
	that practitioners found them useful and identify improvements based
	on the measurements, which were in line with lean and agile principles.
	Furthermore, the practitioners found the measures useful in seeing
	the progress of development for complex products where many tasks
	are executed in parallel. The measures are now an integral part of
	the improvement work at the studied company. Â© 2010 John Wiley

  abstract = {So far, only few in-depth studies focused on the direct comparison
	of process models in general, and between plan-driven and incremental/agile
	approaches in particular. That is, it is not made explicit what the
	effect is of moving from one model to another model. Furthermore,
	there is limited evidence on advantages and issues encountered in
	agile software development, this is specifically true in the context
	of large-scale development. The objective of the paper is to investigate
	how the perception of bottlenecks, unnecessary work, and rework (from
	hereon referred to as issues) changes when migrating from a plan-driven
	to an incremental software development approach with agile practices
	(flexible product backlog, face-to-face interaction, and frequent
	integration), and how commonly perceived these practices are across
	different systems and development roles. The context in which the
	objective should be achieved is large-scale development with a market-driven
	focus. The selection of the context was based on the observation
	in related work that mostly small software development projects were
	investigated and that the investigation was focused on one agile
	model (eXtreme programming). A case study was conducted at a development
	site of Ericsson AB, located in Sweden in the end of 2007. In total
	33 interviews were conducted in order to investigate the perceived
	change when migrating from plan-driven to incremental and agile software
	development, the interviews being the primary source of evidence.
	For triangulation purposes measurements collected by Ericsson were
	considered, the measurements relating to unnecessary work (amount
	of discarded requirements) and rework (data on testing efficiency
	and maintenance effort). Triangulation in this context means that
	the measurements were used to confirm the perceived changes with
	an additional data source. In total 64 issues were identified, 24
	being of general nature and the remaining 40 being local and therefore
	unique to individuals opinions or a specific system. The most common
	ones were documented and analyzed in detail. The commonality refers
	to how many persons in different roles and across the systems studied
	have mentioned the issues for each of the process models. The majority
	of the most common issues relates to plan-driven development. We
	also identified common issues remaining for agile after the migration,
	which were related to testing lead-time, test coverage, software
	release, and coordination overhead. Improvements were identified
	as many issues commonly raised for the plan-driven approach were
	not raised anymore for the incremental and agile approach. It is
	concluded that the recent introduction (start in 2005 with the study
	being conducted in the end of 2007) of incremental and agile practices
	brings added values in comparison to the plan-driven approach, which
	is evident from the absence of critical issues that are encountered
	in plan-driven development. Â© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media,

  abstract = {Software process improvement methods help to continuously refine and
	adjust the software process to improve its performance (e.g., in
	terms of lead-time, quality of the software product, reduction of
	change requests, and so forth). Lean software development propagates
	two important principles that help process improvement, namely identification
	of waste in the process and considering interactions between the
	individual parts of the software process from an end-to-end perspective.
	A large shift of thinking about the own way of working is often required
	to adopt lean. One of the potential main sources of failure is to
	try to make a too large shift about the ways of working at once.
	Therefore, the change to lean has to be done in a continuous and
	incremental way. In response to this we propose a novel approach
	to bring together the quality improvement paradigm and lean software
	development practices, the approach being called Software Process
	Improvement through the Lean Measurement (SPI-LEAM) Method. The method
	allows to assess the performance of the development process and take
	continuous actions to arrive at a more lean software process over
	time. The method is under implementation in industry and an initial
	evaluation of the method has been performed. Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The number of success stories being reported concerning agile software
	development has led to an increase in interest among industries and
	research communities. The purpose of this paper is to identify strengths
	and barriers for 'successful agile deployment' in the software companies.
	This knowledge can benefit software companies planning their current
	strategy for agile deployment. Analysis of 57 developers, architects,
	project managers, customers, quality managers, and line and product
	managers in three case companies identifies 71 strengths and 169
	barriers of agile deployment. The analysis revealed the importance
	of management providing the necessary goals and support for agile
	development. It also indicated the significance of defining a tailored
	process model and giving developers the freedom to improve their
	own agile development process continuously during agile deployment.
	The identified barriers, strengths and recommendations can be used
	as a checklist for planning and/or monitoring the effectiveness of
	agile deployment in software companies. By identifying the barriers
	and strengths of agile deployment, the paper deepens understanding
	of this highly relevant but relatively under-researched phenomenon
	and contributes to the literature on agile deployment and software
	process improvement. Â© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

  abstract = {The VENUS (http://venus.uvic.ca/) and NEPTUNE Canada (http://neptunecanada.
	ca/) cabled ocean observatories have been envisioned from their inception
	as underwater extensions of the Internet. Having sensors connected
	to a network opens up tremendous opportunities, from real-time access
	to sensor measurements to the interactive control of remote assets.
	Moreover, with a software system in control, data from all sensors
	can be managed, archived and made available to the wider community.
	Finally, a data management system can also offer features that are
	unique to centrally managed instrumentation: thanks to communication
	standards, autonomous event detection and reaction becomes a very
	powerful possibility. This talk will summarize the salient features
	of DMAS (Data Management and Archiving System) that have been implemented
	over the past four years as well as the planned features to be delivered
	soon. DMAS consists of two main components: The Data Acquisition
	Framework (DAF) takes care of the interaction with instruments in
	terms of control, monitoring as well as data acquisition and storage.
	The framework also contains operation control tools. The user interaction
	features include data search and retrieval, data distribution. Current
	developments in the Web 2.0 area will provide a complete research
	environment where users will have the ability to work and interact
	on-line with colleagues, process and visualize data, establish observation
	schedules and pre-program autonomous, event detection and reaction.
	We call this environment "Oceans 2.0". The architecture of DMAS is
	focused on limiting the amount of data loss and maximizing up time.
	It is a service oriented architecture, making use of some of the
	more advanced tools available. The code is written in Java and makes
	use of an Enterprise Service Bus and of the publish-and-subscribe
	paradigm. The paper also describes the management approaches that
	were adopted to build DMAS. Good code quality, the continuous support
	of VENUS and the need for flexibility in dealing with rapidly changing
	requirements were the drivers behind the adoption of in-house development,
	the Agile development methodology and the creation of three teams.
	The development team deals with requirement collection, analysis,
	design, coding and unit testing; the QA/QC team performs software
	tests and regression in a production-like environment. The systems/operations
	team focuses on the hardware and system software preparation and
	support, receives and installs new code releases after QA approval
	and monitors systems operations. We are vying to perform new code
	releases twice a month. The method has worked well during the four
	years of the system development phase and has allowed for a constant
	support of VENUS. DMAS will be completed well under budget. Â©2009

	software organizations have implemented for its quality processes
	which are expected to bring a good quality for their software products.
	However, traditional software process models become too heavy-weight
	to be deployed. The aim of this research is to design the Light-Weight
	Project Management (LWPM) approach to implement CMMI by mapping between
	CMMI goals and Agile-Scrum based on defined artifacts and to indicate
	the differences in applying LWPM and the traditional Waterfall model.
	Our approach focuses on the Project Management category which composes
	Project Planning (PP), Project Monitoring and Control (PMC) and Integrated
	Project Management (IPM). In order to compare both models we collected
	relevant data by using questionnaire and also the dedicated tool
	SPIALS (Software Process Improvement Adaptive Learning System).},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the efficacy and pragmatics of mixing two
	primary strategies for requirements prioritization in order to incorporate
	the benefits of both plan-based (PB) and agile development methods
	while avoiding their drawbacks. As it is intractable to directly
	study the performance of strategies on real projects, we conducted
	a comprehensive empirically based simulation under a variety of conditions
	of requirements dynamism, project size, and duration. Simulation
	results suggest that a mixed strategy for requirements prioritization
	seems to work best in all but cost for typical levels of dynamism
	on average. Our findings also indicate that, as theorized, PB and
	agile strategies perform well within opposite extremes of dynamism.
	However, they do not outperform the mixed strategies even within
	their home grounds- that is large and complex systems with stable
	requirements for PB, and small and dynamic projects for agile methods.
	Given the unknown, unknowable, or variable nature of dynamism and
	the dramatic differences in effectiveness for agile and PB strategies
	under extreme development scenarios, a mixed strategy appears to
	yield the best results overall. We introduce two mixed strategies-
	simply adding cost-benefit (CB) to the agile approach, and a more
	sophisticated hybrid (HY) approach that modulates development iteration
	size to maximize the expected CB for each iteration. We propose a
	step-by-step method to implement this HY strategy. We provide a structured
	analysis of the benefits and assumptions of agile and PB requirements
	prioritization methods (e.g., Pareto optimization), and outline a
	framework for analyzing and assessing the effectiveness of strategies
	including several new metrics. This research can furthermore serve
	as a framework for future validation of the proposed mixed strategies
	using actual software projects. Â© 2009 Operational Research Society

	both agree that prioritizing requirements is an essential activity.
	They differ in basic strategy - when to prioritize, to what degree,
	and how to guide implementation. As with many software engineering
	methods, verifying the benefit of following a particular approach
	is a challenge. Industry and student/classroom based experimental
	studies are generally impractical to use for large numbers of controlled
	experiments and benefits are difficult to measure directly. We use
	simulation to validate the fundamental, yet typically intangible
	benefits of requirements prioritization strategies. Our simulation
	is directly based on detailed empirical studies of agile and plan-based
	requirements management studies. Our simulation shows, as many have
	claimed, that an agile strategy excels when requirements are highly
	volatile, whereas a plan-based strategy excels when requirements
	are stable, and that there exist mixed strategies that are better
	than either for typical development efforts. Â© 2008 IEEE.},

	While several approaches have been devised to address this issue,
	ranging from instilling resistance to changing requirements in order
	to mitigate impact to project schedules, to developing an agile mindset
	towards requirements, the approach discussed in this paper is one
	of conceptualizing the delta in requirement and modeling it, in order
	to plan a response to it. To provide some context here, change is
	first formally identified and categorized as either formal change
	or informal change. While agile methodology facilitates informal
	change, the approach discussed in this paper seeks to develop the
	idea of facilitating formal change. To collect, document meta-requirements
	that represent the phenomena of change would be a pro-active measure
	towards building a realistic cognition of the requirements entity
	that can further be harnessed in the software engineering process.},

  abstract = {Agile software development methods focus on the rapid and iterative
	delivery of a software product in small increments. Over the last
	decade, the software industry has shown a substantial interest in
	agile practices but there is no standard guiding vision model or
	framework to adopt and then use to assess or improve the agile method
	in a software development organization; indeed, the absence of a
	guiding vision model could result in the failure of the agile implementation.
	The purpose of this paper is to present an Agile Adoption and Improvement
	Model (AAIM) for the adoption, assessment and improvement of an agile
	software development process. We have analysed the results of several
	agile software process assessments, industrial case studies on the
	adoption of an agile approach and feedback from both researchers
	and the software industry for the construction of the AAIM. The AAIM
	can be used as a gradual road map for the adoption of an agile approach
	so that the required agile level can be achieved and improved over
	a period of time. The AAIM has been organized in three agile blocks,
	six agile stages (AS) and an embedded agility measurement model (to
	quantitatively measure the degree of agility). In AAIM, each stage
	specifies goals that must be achieved to attain a particular business
	value through the use of an agile software development approach.},

	popular means in software engineering. In this position paper, we
	discuss how development management in agile methods can be integrated
	with software product family structure modeling. The integration
	aims towards improving software product family development governance
	by providing technology in terms of concepts and even automated tool
	support for planning, monitoring and controlling the development
	work for different stakeholders. For example, integration provides
	support for prioritization of development tasks and enables monitoring
	the development status of products in a software product family,
	for example. The feasibility of integration is shown by combining
	Kumbang and Agilefant conceptualizations and respective prototype
	tools. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

  abstract = {The Feynman program has been developed during the last years to support
	case studies on the dynamics and entanglement of n-qubit quantum
	registers. Apart from basic transformations and (gate) operations,
	it currently supports a good number of separability criteria and
	entanglement measures, quantum channels as well as the parametrizations
	of various frequently applied objects in quantum information theory,
	such as (pure and mixed) quantum states, hermitian and unitary matrices
	or classical probability distributions. With the present update of
	the Feynman program, we provide a simple access to (the simulation
	of) quantum measurements. This includes not only the widely-applied
	projective measurements upon the eigenspaces of some given operator
	but also single-qubit measurements in various pre- and user-defined
	bases as well as the support for two-qubit Bell measurements. In
	addition, we help perform generalized and POVM measurements. Knowing
	the importance of measurements for many quantum information protocols,
	e.g., one-way computing, we hope that this update makes the Feynman
	code an attractive and versatile tool for both, research and education.

	179 (2008) 647. Does the new version supersede the previous version?:
	Yes. Nature of problem: During the last decade, the field of quantum
	information science has largely contributed to our understanding
	of quantum mechanics, and has provided also new and efficient protocols
	that are used on quantum entanglement. To further analyze the amount
	and transfer of entanglement in n-qubit quantum protocols, symbolic
	and numerical simulations need to be handled efficiently. Solution
	method: Using the computer algebra system Maple, we developed a set
	of procedures in order to support the definition, manipulation and
	analysis of n-qubit quantum registers. These procedures also help
	to deal with (unitary) logic gates and (nonunitary) quantum operations
	and measurements that act upon the quantum registers. All commands
	are organized in a hierarchical order and can be used interactively
	in order to simulate and analyze the evolution of n-qubit quantum
	systems, both in ideal and noisy quantum circuits. Reasons for new
	version: Until the present, the FEYNMAN program supported the basic
	data structures and operations of n-qubit quantum registers [1],
	a good number of separability and entanglement measures [2], quantum
	operations (noisy channels) [3] as well as the parametrizations of
	various frequently applied objects, such as (pure and mixed) quantum
	states, hermitian and unitary matrices or classical probability distributions
	[4]. With the current extension, we here add all necessary features
	to simulate quantum measurements, including the projective measurements
	in various single-qubit and the two-qubit Bell basis, and POVM measurements.
	Together with the previously implemented functionality, this greatly
	enhances the possibilities of analyzing quantum information protocols
	in which measurements play a central role, e.g., one-way computation.
	Running time: Most commands require â‰¤10 seconds of processor
	time on a Pentium 4 processor with â‰¥ 2 GHz RAM or newer, if
	they work with quantum registers with five or less qubits. Moreover,
	about 5-20 MB of working memory is typically needed (in addition
	to the memory for the Maple environment itself). However, especially
	when working with symbolic expressions, the requirements on the CPU
	time and memory critically depend on the size of the quantum registers
	owing to the exponential growth of the dimension of the associated
	Hilbert space. For example, complex (symbolic) noise models, i.e.
	with several Kraus operators, may result in very large expressions
	that dramatically slow down the evaluation of e.g. distance measures
	or the final-state entropy, etc. In these cases, Maple's assume facility
	sometimes helps to reduce the complexity of the symbolic expressions,
	but more often than not only a numerical evaluation is feasible.
	Since the various commands can be applied to quite different scenarios,
	no general scaling rule can be given for the CPU time or the request
	of memory. References: [1] T. Radtke, S. Fritzsche, Comput. Phys.

  abstract = {Entanglement is known today as a key resource in many protocols from
	quantum computation and quantum information theory. However, despite
	the successful demonstration of several protocols, such as teleportation
	or quantum key distribution, there are still many open questions
	of how entanglement affects the efficiency of quantum algorithms
	or how it can be protected against noisy environments. The investigation
	of these and related questions often requires a search or optimization
	over the set of quantum states and, hence, a parametrization of them
	and various other objects. To facilitate this kind of studies in
	quantum information theory, here we present an extension of the Feynman
	program that was developed during recent years as a toolbox for the
	simulation and analysis of quantum registers. In particular, we implement
	parameterizations of hermitian and unitary matrices (of arbitrary
	order), pure and mixed quantum states as well as separable states.
	In addition to being a prerequisite for the study of many optimization
	problems, these parameterizations also provide the necessary basis
	for heuristic studies which make use of random states, unitary matrices
	and other objects. Program summary: Program title: FEYNMAN. Catalogue

	version?: Yes. Nature of problem: During the last decades, quantum
	information science has contributed to our understanding of quantum
	mechanics and has provided also new and efficient protocols, based
	on the use of entangled quantum states. To determine the behavior
	and entanglement of n-qubit quantum registers, symbolic and numerical
	simulations need to be applied in order to analyze how these quantum
	information protocols work and which role the entanglement plays
	hereby. Solution method: Using the computer algebra system Maple,
	we have developed a set of procedures that support the definition,
	manipulation and analysis of n-qubit quantum registers. These procedures
	also help to deal with (unitary) logic gates and (nonunitary) quantum
	operations that act upon the quantum registers. With the parameterization
	of various frequently-applied objects, that are implemented in the
	present version, the program now facilitates a wider range of symbolic
	and numerical studies. All commands can be used interactively in
	order to simulate and analyze the evolution of n-qubit quantum systems,
	both in ideal and noisy quantum circuits. Reasons for new version:
	In the first version of the FEYNMAN program [1], we implemented the
	data structures and tools that are necessary to create, manipulate
	and to analyze the state of quantum registers. Later [2,3], support
	was added to deal with quantum operations (noisy channels) as an
	ingredient which is essential for studying the effects of decoherence.
	With the present extension, we add a number of parametrizations of
	objects frequently utilized in decoherence and entanglement studies,
	such that as hermitian and unitary matrices, probability distributions,
	or various kinds of quantum states. This extension therefore provides
	the basis, for example, for the optimization of a given function
	over the set of pure states or the simple generation of random objects.
	Running time: Most commands that act upon quantum registers with
	five or less qubits take â‰¤10 seconds of processor time on a
	Pentium 4 processor with â‰¥ 2 GHz or newer, and about 5-20 MB
	of working memory (in addition to the memory for the Maple environment).
	Especially when working with symbolic expressions, however, the requirements
	on CPU time and memory critically depend on the size of the quantum
	registers, owing to the exponential growth of the dimension of the
	associated Hilbert space. For example, complex (symbolic) noise models,
	i.e. with several symbolic Kraus operators, result for multi-qubit
	systems often in very large expressions that dramatically slow down
	the evaluation of e.g. distance measures or the final-state entropy,
	etc. In these cases, Maple's assume facility sometimes helps to reduce
	the complexity of the symbolic expressions, but more often only a
	numerical evaluation is possible eventually. Since the complexity
	of the various commands of the FEYNMAN program and the possible usage
	scenarios can be very different, no general scaling law for CPU time
	or the memory requirements can be given. References: [1] T. Radtke,

	The simplicity of this formulation is also helpful for circuit design.

	shift the frequency of the first corner of the phase-noise spectrum,

  abstract = {This work examines the blocking performance of narrowband (NB) and
	wideband (WB) sources that access a shared pool of wireless channels.
	The NB sources utilize a single channel, whereas WB sources access
	simultaneously a larger group of channels. This system is analyzed
	in the context of maximizing the utilization of spectrum that is
	allocated to the WB system by allowing NB sources random access to
	the same spectrum. The performance measure to be controlled is the
	blocking experienced by WB sources. A queueing model of this system
	is proposed that allows evaluation of the impact of NB sources on
	WB performance. Assuming Poisson arrival process models and negative
	exponential distributions for the channel holding times, the dependence
	of the blocking probability of the WB source is derived as a function
	of the NB utilization factor. In an uncontrolled NB access scheme,
	the WB blocking is lower bounded by the blocking probability experienced
	by NB sources. The performance improvement afforded by adding extra
	NB channels and by controlling the access rates of the NB source
	for finite population WB sources is presented. The analysis presented
	here provides an assessment of some of the emerging paradigms for
	adaptive spectrum allocation. Of particular interest are the criteria
	under which spectrum agile, cognitive and software radios functioning
	in an opportunistic fashion can access unused spectrum allocated
	to a primary system without adversely affecting the performance of
	the primary system.},

  abstract = {Compatibility of agile methods and CMMI have been of interest for
	the software engineering community, but empirical evidence beyond
	case studies is scarce, which be attributed to the lack of validated
	measurement scales for survey studies. In this study, we construct
	and validate a set of Rasch scales for measuring process maturity
	and use of agile methods. Using survey data from 86 small and medium-sized
	software product firms, we find that the use of agile methods and
	the maturity level of the firm are complementary in this sample.
	In addition to providing initial survey evidence of the compatibility
	of agile methods and process maturity, our study provides a set of
	validated scales that can be further refined and used in later survey
	studies. Â© 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	combustor is investigated experimentally by high-speed imaging. Ignition
	testing is conducted at two operating conditions: a 'safe' point
	at which relight is possible, and an 'unsafe' condition where ignition
	is precluded by the large air mass flow rate. Image processing software
	has been developed to analyze the motion and breakup of the imaged
	flame. At the safe condition, the developing flame kernels are typically
	swept downstream and towards the fuel-injector center-line, before
	moving upstream. The comparatively large gas-phase velocity at the
	unsafe condition causes rapid disintegration of the ignition kernel.
	At neither condition does the size of the spark kernel determine
	ignition outcome. Good agreement is demonstrated between the measured
	spark-centroid velocity and CFD predictions of gas-phase velocity
	below the igniter tip. Copyright © 2008 by Robert Read.},

  abstract = {Multilevel and multiclass queuing is very common in systems having
	QoS related concerns and one of the most common and well-know approaches
	is Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ). In WFQ there are multiple queues
	and each one is dedicated for a distinct class of jobs or traffic
	and there is a weight value assigned to each queue to indicate the
	number of jobs that has to be picked from the queue in next round.
	This approach uses fixed predefined weight values tuned by system
	administrator with knowledge about system's characteristics. In this
	paper we extend WFQ approach by adding a fuzzy inference system and
	QoS measurement component. The proposed algorithm uses its easy-to-extend
	and agile knowledge base to configure the queue weights dynamically
	and autonomously in reaction to recent QoS metrics to achieve better
	performance and improved QoS. The Proposed method tailored to be
	used in virtual resource management environments especially in Grid
	services. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm,
	simulation software used to compare it with well-known queue management
	approaches. The simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed
	algorithm. Â© 2011 IEEE.},

	can become known and subsequently monitored, blocked, or its member
	nodes identified and attacked. Frequent and diverse protocol change
	is key to allowing information to continue to flow. Typically, decentralized
	and locally-customized protocol evolution is also an important aspect
	in providing censor-resistance. A programmable overlay network can
	provide this type of manually-initiated protocol diversification.
	We have prototyped such an extension to Freenet, a peer-to-peer storage

	use of agile methods to develop Internet websites their quality.
	An agile method is a new product development process that is often
	associated with the Internet software industry. Agile methods are
	characterized by factors of iterative development, customer feedback,
	well-structured teams, and flexibility. Use of agile methods may
	improve software quality by injecting customer feedback into a stream
	of working software versions to converge on a solution. Surveys of
	250 software professionals were used to help determine whether the
	use of agile methods improves the quality of Internet websites. The
	central contributions of this study include conceptual models, survey
	instruments, and original measurement data for agile methods and
	website quality. Our findings indicated iterative development and
	customer feedback were related to website quality, but well-structured

  abstract = {Abstract: The purpose of this chapter is to present a literature review
	relevant to a study of using agile methods to manage the development
	of Internet websites and their subsequent quality. This chapter places
	website quality within the context of the $2.4 trillion U.S. electronic
	commerce industry. Thus, this chapter provides a history of electronic
	computers, electronic commerce, software methods, software quality
	metrics, agile methods and studies on agile methods. None of these
	histories are without controversy. For instance, some scholars begin
	the study of the electronic computer by mentioning the emergence
	of the Sumerian text, Hammurabi code or the abacus. We, however,
	will align our history with the emergence of the modern electronic
	computer at the beginning of World War II. The history of electronic
	commerce also has poorly defined beginnings. Some studies of electronic
	commerce begin with the widespread use of the Internet in the early
	1990s. However, electronic commerce cannot be appreciated without
	establishing a deeper context. Few scholarly studies, if any, have
	been performed on agile methods, which is the basic purpose of this
	literature review. That is, to establish the context to conduct scholarly
	research within the fields of agile methods and electronic commerce.

  abstract = {Purpose - The problem of cyclic variation has been an interesting
	area of research and has been investigated by many researchers. It
	is more severe in the case of two-stroke engines compared with four-stroke
	engines. One of the reasons for these cycle-to-cycle variations is
	the variations in the air-fuel ratios of individual cycles and, if
	these values of individual cycle air-fuel ratios are available by
	some means, they can be used for controlling the cyclic variations.
	The purpose of this paper is to find a technique to predict the air-fuel
	ratio of the individual cycles and use the same for reducing cyclic
	variations. Design/methodology/approach - In this work, a neuro-fuzzy
	model was developed using MATLAB software to compute the air-fuel
	ratio of the individual cycles based on the relationship between
	the air-fuel ratio and the combustion parameters such as those indicating
	mean effective pressure (IMEP), crank angle occurrence of peak pressure,
	and angles of different percentages of heat releases. In-cylinder
	pressure traces of 1,000 continuous cycles were measured using a
	Personal Computer (PC)-based data acquisition system and an investigation
	was carried out. The readings were taken for two modes of operations,
	namely gasoline carburetion and electronic gasoline injection. The
	engine was loaded by an eddy current dynamometer. The air-fuel ratio
	was varied from rich to lean by adjusting the fuel quantity in the
	carburetion mode and adjusting the pulse width (measure of quantity
	of fuel to be injected) in the injection mode, at constant throttle.
	The cyclic variation was identified by the variations in the peak
	pressures and IMEPs of the individual cycles. The stored data were
	given as input to the developed neuro-fuzzy model and, using SIMULINK,
	the air-fuel ratios of individual cycles were obtained. These predicted
	values are fed to the electronic control module (ECM) (meant for
	injecting the fuel) for refining the pulse width to get cyclic variations
	reduced. Findings - Results show that cyclic variation increases
	when the mixture becomes lean. It was also found that cyclic variation
	in an injected engine was less in comparison with the carbureted
	engine, as the precise control of air-fuel mixture was possible in
	the case of the injected engine. Research limitations/implications
	- The technique used in this work may be modified to give more precise
	pulse width by incorporating various other parameters like exhaust
	temperature, etc. Future research may be focused to incorporate this
	system in a moving vehicle to get more fuel efficiency and fewer
	emissions. Practical implications - The design of vehicle and engine
	should be slightly modified to incorporate the ECM and various sensors.
	Originality/value - The originality in this paper is that a new technique
	was developed to find the air-fuel ratio of individual cycles. This
	will be useful for the engine manufacturers and for those researchers
	doing research on the engine side. Â© Emerald Group Publishing

	the Gas Research Institute (GRI) began an effort to develop measurement
	methods and emission estimation techniques for glycol dehydrators.

  abstract = {A fundamental aspect of software product quality is the possibility
	of measuring. Therefore, measurement applied to the software product
	and processes has become a need, even in the smallest organizations
	where agile methodologies are applied. The objective of this paper
	is to describe a proposal of a hybrid measurement process for the
	ISO/IEC 15504-ISO/IEC 12207:2008 standards and CMMI Dev 1.3 model
	in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The hybrid process was obtained
	through the definition of a cluster of tasks valid in both models.
	The motivation and viability of having hybrid processes in small
	organizations is analyzed. Besides, the use of hybrid processes as
	basic processes that are able to be fitted in similar processes in
	differents quality models and standards is discussed. Moreover, the
	definition of hybrid processes in order to provide a support in the
	creation of processes compatible in different models and standards
	is included. Â© 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {In this paper we operationally define and measure tacit knowledge
	at the team-level in the software development domain. Through a series
	of three empirical studies we developed and validated the team tacit
	knowledge measure (TTKM) for software developers. In the first study,
	initial scale items were developed using the repertory grid technique
	and content analysis. In Study 2, supplied repertory grids were administered
	to novices and experts to establish differential items, and Study
	3 validated the TTKM on a sample of 48 industrial software development
	teams. In developing the TTKM we explored the relationships between
	tacit knowledge, explicit job knowledge and social interaction and
	their effect on team performance as measured by efficiency and effectiveness.
	In addition we assess the implications for managing software development
	teams and increasing team performance through social interaction.

	(b) SUNMOS. The chief drawbacks of OSF/1 AD are (a) OSF/1 AD takes
	about 8 MB of memory on each node of the Paragon, (b) messages can
	be sent only at a bandwidth of 30-35 MB per second compared to 200
	MB per second peak advertised rate, (c) latencies are on the order
	of 100 microseconds using Intel NX calls under OSF1/ AD. All these
	drawbacks can be minimized by using SUNMOS. SUNMOS takes only 250
	KB of memory on each node and can send messages at bandwidth of 170
	MB per second with latencies of 70 microseconds. We have measured
	the performance of applications under OSF/1 AD and SUNMOS and found
	that under OSF/1 AD, performance does not scale as the number of
	nodes increases, whereas under SUNMOS it seems to scale because of
	higher communication bandwidth.},

  abstract = {These days, commodity-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software are
	used to build high-end and powerful workstations and servers to be
	deployed in today's local area networks of private homes and small-
	to medium-sized business. Typically, these servers are multipurpose
	and shared - running networking functionalities involving IP packet
	forwarding in addition to other CPU intensive applications. In this
	paper we study and investigate the impact of running CPU-bound applications
	on the performance of IP packet forwarding. We measure and compare
	the impact and performance for the two operating systems of choice
	for home and small-business users, namely Linux and Windows XP. The
	performance is studied in terms of key performance metrics which
	include throughput, packet loss, round-trip delay, and CPU availability.
	For our measurements, we consider today's typical home network hosts
	of modern processors and Gigabit network cards. We also consider
	different configuration setups and utilize open-source tools to generate
	relatively high traffic rates. Our empirical results show that Linux
	exhibits superior performance over Windows XP in terms of IP forwarding
	performance. Results also show that, unlike Windows XP, the IP forwarding
	performance of Linux is not significantly impacted by running CPU-bound
	applications. Â© J.UCS.},

	to packet forwarding) of three popular operating systems when used
	in today's Gigabit Ethernet networks. Specifically, the paper compares
	the performance in terms of packet forwarding of Linux, Windows Server
	and Windows XP. We measure both kernel- and user-level packet forwarding
	when subjecting hosts to different traffic load conditions. The performance
	is compared and analyzed in terms of throughput, packet loss, delay,
	and CPU availability. Our evaluation methodology is based on packet-forwarding
	measurement which is a standard and popular benchmark and evaluation
	methodology to assess the performance of network elements such as
	servers, gateways, routers, and switches. Our evaluation methodology
	considers different configuration setups and utilizes open-source
	software tools to generate relatively high traffic rates. We consider
	today's typical network hosts of modern processors and Gigabit network
	cards. Our measurements show that in general Linux exhibits superior
	overall performance in the case of kernel (or IP) packet forwarding,

	alone or combined with other agile practices. Besides, CMMI (Capability
	Maturity Model Integration) is accepted as a suitable model to measure
	the maturity of the organizations when developing or acquiring software.
	Although these two approaches are often considered antagonist, the
	use of an agile approach to reach certain CMMI maturity levels may
	result beneficial to organizations that develop Web systems, since
	they would take the advantages of both approaches. In Web community,
	this union may be very interesting, because agile approaches fits
	with the special needs of Web development, and they could be a useful
	tool for companies getting a certain grade of maturity. This work
	analyzes the goals of CMMI maturity level 2 and the feasibility of
	achieving them using the practices proposed by Scrum, trying to assess
	whether the use of this methodology is suitable for meeting the CMMI
	generic and specific goals or not. Finally, and based on this analysis,

	A complete description of its software and hardware components is

	In this paper, we report on a post hoc analysis of the results of
	an IBM team who has sustained use of TDD for five years and over
	ten releases of a Java-implemented product. The team worked from
	a design and wrote tests incrementally before or while they wrote
	code and, in the process, developed a significant asset of automated
	tests. The IBM team realized sustained quality improvement relative
	to a pre-TDD project and consistently had defect density below industry
	standards. As a result, our data indicate that the TDD practice can
	aid in the production of high quality products. This quality improvement
	would compensate for the moderate perceived productivity losses.
	Additionally, our data indicates that the use of TDD may decrease
	the degree to which code complexity increases as software ages, as
	measured by cyclomatic complexity metric. Â© 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The data utilized on daily mass balance in oil refineries are generated
	from the records of products movements and flow and quality measurements
	existing in the refining processes. This data usually shows low quality
	and inconsistencies and it should be examined and treated. It was
	used a technique of data reconciliation to assess those inconsistencies
	and generate a set of data that allow reliable analysis, which support
	decisions about process. The data generated by data reconciliation
	are going to feed the accounting systems and support decisions of
	the operation and analysis teams. In order to improve data reconciliation
	system management data, it became more agile and practical, it is
	necessary to treat raw data that come from site and were recorded
	in the refinery information systems. The software developed has a
	function of capture raw data record in the system of registration
	and control of operations and link these data with measurements in
	the refining processes. This pooling of information brings a gain
	of quantity and quality to the data reconciliation system, reducing
	mathematical problems of non-solubility drive by configuration of
	refining processes and allocation of measurements. The software also
	evaluates the closing of balance sheet of each tank and carries a
	previous distribution of differences, which come from low precision
	of measurements. This functionality of system intended that data
	were as close to reality of the process as possible and also attend
	accounting requirements, increasingly rigid, imposed to oil refining
	companies. To achieve this goal, it was made modificationson a consecrated
	numerical technique, in order to adapt this to the problem and to
	the singular objective function that mathematically describes the
	problem, All these analyses are generated by software algorithms
	and occur automatically in hours previously scheduled. With the data
	processed in the case of mathematical problems and evaluated in order
	to attend mass balance constraints, reports are generated and will
	be used by analysis accounting team of refinery. This software is
	deployed in the largest Brazilian oil refinery and the data generated
	through it as used as the basis for the accounting closure of this
	site. Â© 2009 Elsevier BV. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The clock offset between a GPS-based NTP time server and NTP time
	client software, installed in the MS Windows Operating System (OS)
	and the Linux OS on PCs, are measured and evaluated. The clock offset
	on MS Windows 98 OS shows a trend with a range of about 55 ms. The
	NTP time client software on MS Windows OS adjusts the internal clock
	with the Application Program Interface (API) timer function. The
	resolution of the API timer function depends on the hardware interrupt
	of the PC system timer, which is 54.9 ms of IRQ0 for MS Windows 98
	OS. Thus, this range of the trend in the clock offset is considered
	to be caused by the resolution of API timer function. The clock offset
	on MS Windows XP OS shows time resolutions of 1 ms for the 1 ms API
	timer mode and 10 ms for the 10 ms API timer mode. The resolution
	of 1 ms is dependent on a hardware interrupt of IRQ8 (976 Î¼s)
	that is generated by a PC real-time clock. The resolution of the
	system timer on MS-windows XP depends on the hardware platform and
	shows 10 ms or 15ms. The clock offset on Linux OS also has a trend
	as well as a periodic divergence. The trend interval of the drift
	is estimated to be about 35 minutes. The origin of this trend in
	interval is presumed to be the loop constant of the kernel Phase
	Lock Loop (PLL). The Standard Deviation of this clock offset for
	24 hours is 0.95 ms. Evidently, both MS Windows OS and Linux OS adopt
	different algorithms for keeping the internal clock. The accuracy
	of time synchronization by NTP is restricted by the algorithms. The
	limitation of the time synchronization accuracy on MS Windows OS
	is related to the resolution of API that depends on a hardware interrupt
	generated in the PC hardware system timer and real-time clock. On
	the other hand, the loop constant of the kernel clock algorithm restricts
	the time synchronization accuracy by NTP on Linux OS.},

	is steadily increasing in the software industry. Software and system
	developers require practical and systematic approaches to obtain
	sufficient and credible evidence of the security level in the system
	under development in order to guide their efforts and ensure the
	efficient use of resources. We present experiences of developing
	and using hierarchical security metrics and measurements in an industrial
	pilot study at Ericsson Finland. The pilot focused on risk-driven
	security design and implementation in the context of an Agile software
	development process. The pilot target was a well-established telecommunications
	product of Ericsson and a core component in modern mobile networks.
	The results of the study demonstrate the practical potential of risk-driven
	security metrics, particularly in offering some early visibility
	of security effectiveness and efficiency. Hierarchical metrics models
	enable the linking of security objectives with detailed measurements.
	Security metrics visualization was found to play a crucial role in
	increasing the manageability of metrics. We also found that the practical
	means of managing larger collections of metrics and measurements
	are more essential than individual security metrics. A major challenge
	in the use of risk-driven security metrics is the lack of evidence
	for security effectiveness evidence in the early phases of product
	development and Risk Analysis, when the needs for it are at their
	greatest. Â© J.UCS.},

  abstract = {Railcar condition directly affects the safety, the efficiency, and
	the reliability of freight railroad operations. Current railcar inspection
	practices are intended to identify defects before failure, but these
	practices generally do not enable preventive maintenance because
	manual, visual inspection is inherently limited. As a result, automated
	wayside conditionmonitoring technologies have been developed to monitor
	rolling stock condition and facilitate predictive maintenance strategies.
	Improving the effectiveness of monitoring of railcar conditions could
	substantially reduce in-service failures and derailments, operational
	waste, and variability in rail operations and could enhance network
	productivity, capacity, and reliability. An analysis of the effect
	of lean production methods on main-line railway operations was conducted
	to determine the potential impact of improved railcar inspection
	and maintenance practices made possible by new, automated wayside
	technologies. Dispatch simulation software was used to quantify the
	magnitude and the variability of train delay as a function of both
	traffic level and severity of service outage. The results indicated
	that the annual cost caused by main-line delay was substantial compared
	with the annual cost of track and equipment damages from main-line
	derailments caused by mechanical causes. This work provided an analytical
	framework to assess the potential cost savings available through
	improved preventive maintenance strategies.},

	eXtreme Programming, state that refactoring is one of the key activities
	to be undertaken in order to keep the code-base of a project well-structured
	and consistent. In such a context, poorly structured code may become
	a significant obstacle in adding new or in enhancing existing functionality.
	However, there is some anecdotal evidence that in many software projects,
	the underlying code-base is not necessarily refactored post-release,
	often due to time constraints or the misconception that refactoring
	does not add any apparent value. In order to get further insights
	into this problem area, we propose to investigate the usage frequency
	of refactorings in the context of open-source, object-oriented software
	systems. In this work, we will outline our approach to detecting
	refactoring and present results obtained from an initial pilot study.

  abstract = {Identifying refactoring opportunities in software systems is an important
	activity in today's agile development environments. The concept of
	code smells has been proposed to characterize different types of
	design shortcomings in code. Additionally, metric-based detection
	algorithms claim to identify the "smelly" components automatically.
	This paper presents results for an empirical study performed in a
	commercial environment. The study investigates the way professional
	software developers detect god class code smells, then compares these
	results to automatic classification. The results show that, even
	though the subjects perceive detecting god classes as an easy task,
	the agreement for the classification is low. Misplaced methods are
	a strong driver for letting subjects identify god classes as such.
	Earlier proposed metric-based detection approaches performed well
	compared to the human classification. These results lead to the conclusion
	that an automated metric-based pre-selection decreases the effort
	spent on manual code inspections. Automatic detection accompanied
	by a manual review increases the overall confidence in the results
	of metric-based classifiers. Â© 2010 ACM.},

	used for projects in which the team cannot clearly express the scope
	early in the product life cycle. An agile project team typically
	uses several iterations or deliveries of software instead of waiting
	until the end of the project to provide one product. This paper suggests
	that the project management process groups (initiating, planning,

	an agile approach, but there are several different terms, techniques,

	Kanban. The third level maintenance is performed by the Customer
	Support Request (CSR) teams and by the design maintenance teams,
	which are located in two sites. There are separate backlogs for the
	customer support and for the design maintenance in the primary site
	and a third backlog for the design maintenance in the secondary site.
	Pull mindset, team working, team empowerment, and continuous improvement
	have become part of the everyday activities. Best practices from
	Scrum have been selected to complement the Kanban implementation.
	Also, the metrics have been reviewed. The major challenges have been
	related to the boundary rules, for instance, multi-site working,
	the platform dependency and the service level agreements but also
	to the roles and responsibilities. The Kanban boards and the chosen
	practices have been adjusted as the understanding of Lean has increased.
	This industry paper presents the journey to Lean product maintenance
	including the identification of the key success factors that are
	to some extent generalizable. First, the overall implementation is
	discussed followed by a deeper description of the implementation
	both in the CSR handling and in the Fault Handling (design maintenance)
	including also the experiences from the secondary R&D site. The paper
	continues by discussing the identified challenges and positive effects.
	At the end of the paper, the implementation concepts and key success
	factors are stated. Â© 2011 IEEE.},

	Problems during the operation and control of transitions originate
	from alarm floods, out-of-spec products, and abnormal situations.
	Recent research has sought to address these issues albeit in a piece-meal
	fashion. In this paper, we review these methods and critically evaluate
	their strengths and shortcomings. We show that none of the methods
	can adequately tackle the numerous facets of this complex problem;
	hence an integrated solution and collaboration among heterogeneous
	methods is essential. We propose a software agent-based framework

	inherent uncertainty of a software project. The approach is exemplified
	through a specific BN model of an antipattern. The antipattern is
	modeled using the empirical results of a controlled experiment on
	Extreme Programming (XP) that investigated the impact of developer
	personalities and temperaments on communication, collaboration-pair
	viability and effectiveness in pair programming. The resulting BN

  abstract = {Following on from the author's reviews of the stability and control
	of motorcycles in 1978 and 1985, the paper treats the earlier material
	in tutorial fashion and adds more recent information. Fixed and free
	control properties are compared and it is concluded essential to
	the operation of a motorcycle that the steering system is free. Motorcycles
	typically possess lightly damped oscillatory modes and the properties
	of these modes are discussed. Small perturbations from straight line
	motion and from cornering equilibrium states are treated. Steering
	control by handlebar torque and by rider upper body lean torque are
	compared. The behaviour of the rider as an extension of the structure
	of the machine and as a controller is also discussed. Theoretical
	analysis, experimental measurements and general experience are linked
	as far as possible. More recent years have seen a strong movement
	towards the use of structurally efficient frames for large motorcycles,
	in particular, and multibody dynamics software for h andling analysis.
	Theoretical predictions can be extended in ways hardly possible before
	automated multibody analysis became available. The state of the art
	is illustrated with a description of a contemporary motorcycle /
	rider model and some results which are derived from it. Directions
	for future work are indicated.},

  abstract = {Software refactoring is a collection of reengineering activities that
	aims to improve software quality. Refactorings are commonly used
	in agile software processes to improve software quality after a significant
	software development or evolution. There is belief that refactoring
	improves quality factors such as understandability, flexibility,
	and reusability. However, there is limited empirical evidence to
	support such assumptions. The aim of this study is to confirm such
	claims using a hierarchal quality model. We study the effect of software
	refactoring on software quality. We provide details of our findings
	as heuristics that can help software developers make more informed
	decisions about what refactorings to perform in regard to improve
	a particular quality factor. We validate the proposed heuristics
	in an empirical setting on two open-source systems. We found that
	the majority of refactoring heuristics do improve quality; however
	some heuristics do not have a positive impact on all software quality
	factors. In addition, we found that the impact analysis of refactorings
	divides software measures into two categories: high and low impacted
	measures. These categories help in the endeavor to know the best
	measures that can be used to identify refactoring candidates. We
	validated our findings on two open-source systems-Eclipse and Struts.
	For both systems, we found consistency between the heuristics and
	the actual refactorings.},

	of dollars are spent on failed software projects. Lack of an end
	user involvement, poor requirements, and unrealistic schedules are
	some of the top reasons of such failure. Agile software development
	is an approach that addresses these problems through a real communication
	between programmers and customers. Thus, there is a need to quantify
	software agility. In this paper, an approach for quantitying software
	agility is provided by modeling the key concepts in agile software
	and proposing a measure that can be used in representing how agile
	a software development process is. The proposed measure employs information
	entropy as the main concept related to software agility. The suggested
	measure is tested on two open source case studies. Experimental results
	demonstrate the validity and suitability of the agility measure.

	at Delphi Diesel Systems in Gillingham, Kent explained how the company
	improved its design and production engineering processes to significanly
	slash delivery time of sample diesel injection pumps. The design
	to manufacture process starts with three dimensional designing in
	SolidWorks. Some parts are rapid prototyped using the Fused Deposition
	Modeling facility at the University in Greenwich in Chatham. CAM
	instructions are prepared with Virtual Gibbs CAM while Vericut is
	used for post processing and verification of tool paths. Finally,
	the Seiki Systems Program Management Machine Monitoring software
	is used to supervise machining. For 2007, the target is complete
	sample manufacture in four weeks instead of five.},

  abstract = {During the past decade, the Internet, Web and intelligent agents have
	been used in attempts to implement distributed intelligent manufacturing
	systems. Network communication and message services are important
	aspects for such systems. This paper first introduces a new concept
	called iShopFloor-an intelligent shop floor based on the Internet,
	Web and agent technologies. The paper then reports some of our recent
	work on the implementation of XML-based message services for Internet-enabled,
	agent-based, intelligent shop floors. The objective is to investigate
	XML for message exchanges among Internet-enabled shop floor devices
	that are represented by intelligent agents. The paper discusses the
	advantages of using XML for message services and presents our initial
	implementation within the iShopFloor prototype environment. This
	implementation has demonstrated the following advantages of using
	XML-based message services on the shop floor: (1) simplification
	and standardization of message services in Internet-based, intelligent
	shop floors; (2) facilitation of the integration of an agent-based
	scheduling system with other intelligent shop floor systems, including
	Web-based shop floor monitoring and control systems; and (3) possibility
	of creating data views on the fly. © 2005 IJAM.},

	how the application of Object-Oriented Analysis techniques can be
	borrowed from the software development paradigm and applied to Performance
	Management. This methodology, Object-Oriented Performance Management
	(OOPM) lends itself well to the management of distributed systems

  abstract = {Computer software is an engine of growth of social-economy development
	which requires new engineering techniques and strategies. The demand
	for quality in software applications has grown. Hence as software
	becomes more integrated into our lives, the effects of software failures
	become more acute. Testing is an essential part of software development
	providing an indicator of the quality of the software. Testing remains
	the primary way to improve reliability of software. Billions of dollars
	are spent on testing in the software industry, as testing usually
	accounts for more than half the cost of software development. The
	demand of new engineering technologies for quality in software applications
	has grown and awareness of software testing-related issues plays
	an important role of all testing levels. The unit level of testing
	has undergone the most recent and most dramatic change. With the
	introduction of new agile (aka, "lightweight") development methods,
	such as XP (eXtreme Programming) came the idea of Test-Driven Development
	(TDD). The TDD is a software development engineering technique that
	melds program design, implementation and testing in a series micro-iterations
	that focus on simplicity and feedback. Programmer tests are created
	using a unit testing framework and are 100% automated. This paper
	contributes in the development of TDD framework for testing of unit,
	which includes new engineering concepts and the methodologies issues
	in form of TDD techniques using V design model especially for engineering
	education, industrial training and software development. Â© 2010

  abstract = {The ultimate goal of computer design is to satisfy the end-user. In
	particular computing domains, such as interactive applications, there
	exists a variation in user expectations and user satisfaction relative
	to the performance of existing computer systems. In this work, we
	leverage this variation to develop more efficient architectures that
	are customized to end-users. We first investigate the relationship
	between microarchitectural parameters and user satisfaction. Specifically,
	we analyze the relationship between hardware performance counter
	(HPC) readings and individual satisfaction levels reported by users
	for representative applications. Our results show that the satisfaction
	of the user is strongly correlated to the performance of the underlying
	hardware. More importantly, the results show that user satisfaction
	is highly user-dependent. To take advantage of these observations,
	we develop a framework called Individualized Dynamic Voltage and
	Frequency Scaling (iDVFS). We study a group of users to characterize
	the relationship between the HPCs and individual user satisfaction
	levels. Based on this analysis, we use artificial neural networks
	to model the function from HPCs to user satisfaction for individual
	users. This model is then used online to predict user satisfaction
	and set the frequency level accordingly. A second set of user studies
	demonstrates that iDVFS reduces the CPU power consumption by over
	25% in representative applications as compared to the Windows XP
	DVFS algorithm. Â© 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Many organizations aspire to adopt agile processes to take advantage
	of the numerous benefits that they offer to an organization. Those
	benefits include, but are not limited to, quicker return on investment,
	better software quality, and higher customer satisfaction. To date,
	however, there is no structured process (at least that is published
	in the public domain) that guides organizations in adopting agile
	practices. To address this situation, we present the agile adoption
	framework and the innovative approach we have used to implement it.
	The framework consists of two components: an agile measurement index,
	and a four-stage process, that together guide and assist the agile
	adoption efforts of organizations. More specifically, the Sidky Agile
	Measurement Index (SAMI) encompasses five agile levels that are used
	to identify the agile potential of projects and organizations. The
	four-stage process, on the other hand, helps determine (a) whether
	or not organizations are ready for agile adoption, and (b) guided
	by their potential, what set of agile practices can and should be
	introduced. To help substantiate the 'goodness' of the Agile Adoption
	Framework, we presented it to various members of the agile community,
	and elicited responses through questionnaires. The results of that
	substantiation effort are encouraging, and are also presented in
	this paper. Â© Springer-Verlag London Limited 2007.},

	This paper presents the results from a comparative case study of

	TDD is one of the most fundamental practices enabling the development
	of software in an agile and iterative manner. Both the literature

	it is claimed that TDD leads to an improved software design, which
	has a dramatic impact on the maintainability and further development
	of the system. The impact of TDD on program design has seldom come
	under the researchers' focus. This paper reports the results from
	a comparative case study of three software development projects where
	the effect of TDD on program design was measured using object-oriented
	metrics. The results show that the effect of TDD on program design

  abstract = {This paper proposes a learner-centric, light-weight small scale tool
	that facilitates the needs of scaled-down development environments.
	The development of a Software Quality Resource Tool (SQRT) was initiated
	based on a development process, a set of quality metrics and a set
	of associated standards outlined in our earlier paper. The development
	process is based on Agile practices. The quality metrics were generated
	via a goal-question-metrics process (GQM) and include metrics for
	tracking product and process quality. Associated standards included
	benchmarks for each metric, and a set of documentation, coding, and
	logging procedures. The SQRT tool functions with just enough project
	planning, configuration management, design and coding functionality
	to support single-source documentation, and integrates coding with
	fully automated metrics tracking and reporting. SQRT facilitates
	compliance to the software development process and quality practices
	implemented in scaled-down development environments.},

	we were, and what needed doing first. We found some issues, and while
	working on this paper discovered that others have found similar patterns,
	most notably Linda Rising in her book "Fearless Change" ii. Obstacles
	we found include the necessity to obtain and maintain support of
	leadership, the influence of tooling on the implementation, and the
	need to go step-by-step: get agile skills in teams before attempting
	to change the full Software Development Life Cycle. We had great
	results from made-to-measure training of the teams around the globe,

  abstract = {Measuring programmer productivity is a challenging exercise because
	it is not well understood since it is without bounded rules and ill-defined
	meanings of complicated set of parameters. This is made worse by
	new software development paradigms such as agile and mashup methods
	and the ensuing advances in software engineering practices and ways
	of designing and developing software. The existing metrics for measuring
	performance of solo and pairs of programmers does not appear to be
	suitable to meet these new forms of software development. This paper
	presents a new metrics which can be used to measure performance productivity
	of programming effort by solo and pair programmers in a much more
	comprehensive manner. All of the key parameters are looked at objectively
	and defined for and from software engineering lifecycle points of
	view to make productivity performance calculations for solo and pair
	programmers. The methodology used for formulating and composing the
	formulae and defining the parameters as coefficients is explained.
	These parameters are based on a weighting system to derive the effective
	performance results. It is a more objective and quick way for the
	performance analysts to define a table of weights for the parameters
	based on several criteria within the different aspects of the software
	development lifecycle. The composition of the formulae and the metric
	for measuring programmer productivity performance is presented and
	examples are used to illustrate the method and the outcomes. Â©

	EVMS with principles and guidelines for true integration of project
	cost, schedule, and technical performance. It is derived from standards
	and capability and maturity models for systems engineering and project
	management. PBEV overcomes several shortcomings of EVMS. EVMS specifically
	excludes the measurement of product quality and is silent on risk
	management. In contrast, PBEV bases earned value on product quality
	requirements, technical performance, and technical maturity. It also
	incorporates the outcomes of risk management into revised plans and
	the Estimate at Completion (EAC). PBEV supports agile systems development
	because it is scalable to match the project risk and is responsive
	to changing product requirements. PBEV evolved from lessons learned
	in both the U.S. defense industry and the commercial software industry
	in India. It is also cost-effective. The principles and guidelines

  abstract = {This paper presents the process of measuring the level of quality
	control process to ensure the quality of delivered software package
	during the development cycle. The success of the project requires
	three prerequisites and they constrain one another. Quality is the
	most important factor for successful project completion. In other
	words, quality should not be sacrificed for the sake of meeting cost
	budget or delivering within schedule. Also, cost caused by any quality
	issues such as defect resolution increases exponentially once the
	product is out of the door. Having said that, we also have to consider
	the schedule side of constraints for the successful project. In other
	words, we have no time to do a quality job and we have to compete
	with other competitors to ship the product to the market earlier
	than them. So, the quality measurement and management concept is
	introduced to meet the agile software development environment in
	conjunction with performance strategies to execute within organization.
	Obviously, there are many key performance indexes derivable from
	the actual data associated with quality control activities and it
	is desirable to create a quality process to integrally represent
	overall level of quality control activities performed while developing
	the software deliverables. With the quality process, it is possible
	to evaluate whether enough quality control activities are performed
	for the project officially and secure the quality of the software
	deliverables before it is delivered to the customers. Â© 2011 Song

	and managing a distributed project from an information flow perspective
	helps to facilitate available communication channels right from the
	start - beyond the documents and artifacts which are defined for
	a given development process. In this paper we propose FLOW Mapping,
	a systematic approach for planning and managing information flows
	in distributed projects. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach
	with a case study in a distributed agile class room project. FLOW
	Mapping is sufficient to plan communication and to measure conformance
	to the communication strategy. We also discuss cost and impact of
	our approach. Â© 2011 IEEE.},

	software products faster and with better quality - thus leaving little
	room for unnecessary activities or non-optimal capacity. To achieve
	the desired high speed of the projects and the optimal capacity,bottlenecks
	existing in the projects have to be monitored and effectively removed.
	The objective of this research is to show experiences from a mature
	software development organization working according to Lean and Agile
	software development principles. By conducting a formal case study
	at Ericsson we were able to elicit and automate measures required
	to monitor bottlenecks in software development workflow, evaluated
	in one of the projects. The project developed software for one of
	the telecom products and consisted of over 80 developers. The results
	of the case study include a measurement system with a number of measures/indicators
	which can indicate existence of bottlenecks in the flow of work in
	the project and a number of good practices helping other organizations
	to start monitoring bottlenecks in an effective way - in particular
	what to focus on when designing such a measurement system. Â© 2011

  abstract = {Context: Predicting a number of defects to be resolved in large software
	projects (defect backlog) usually requires complex statistical methods
	and thus is hard to use on a daily basis by practitioners in industry.
	Making predictions in simpler and more robust way is often required
	by practitioners in software engineering industry. Objective: The
	objective of this paper is to present a simple and reliable method
	for forecasting the level of defect backlog in large, lean-based
	software development projects. Method: The new method was created
	as part of an action research project conducted at Ericsson. In order
	to create the method we have evaluated multivariate linear regression,
	expert estimations and analogy-based predictions w.r.t. their accuracy
	and ease-of-use in industry. We have also evaluated the new method
	in a life project at one of the units of Ericsson during a period
	of 21 weeks (from the beginning of the project until the release
	of the product). Results: The method for forecasting the level of
	defect backlog uses an indicator of the trend (an arrow) as a basis
	to forecast the level of defect backlog. Forecasts are based on moving
	average which combined with the current level of defect backlog was
	found to be the best prediction method (Mean Magnitude of Relative
	Error of 16%) for the level of future defect backlog. Conclusion:
	We have found that ease-of-use and accuracy are the main aspects
	for practitioners who use predictions in their work. In this paper
	it is concluded that using the simple moving average provides a sufficiently-good
	accuracy (much appreciated by practitioners involved in the study).
	We also conclude that using the indicator (forecasting the trend)
	instead of the absolute number of defects in the backlog increases
	the confidence in our method compared to our previous attempts (regression,
	analogy-based, and expert estimates). Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

  abstract = {An emerging generation of mission-critical systems employs distributed,
	dynamically reconfigurable open architectures. These systems may
	include a variety of devices that sense and affect their environment
	and the configuration of the system itself. We call such systems
	Networked Cyber-Physical Systems (NCPS). NCPS can provide complex,
	situation-aware, and often critical services in applications such
	as distributed sensing and surveillance, crisis response, self-assembling
	structures or systems, networked satellite and unmanned vehicle missions,
	or distributed critical infrastructure monitoring and control. In
	this paper we lay out research directions centered around a new paradigm
	for the design of NCPS based on a notion of software fractionation
	that we are currently exploring which can serve as the basis for
	a new generation of runtime assurance techniques. The idea of software
	fractionation is inspired by and complementary to hardware fractionation
	- the basis for the fractionated satellites of DARPA's F6 program.
	Fractionated software has the potential of leading to software that
	is more robust, leveraging both diversity and redundancy. It raises
	the level of abstraction at which assurance techniques are applied.
	We specifically propose research in just-in-time verification and
	validation techniques, which are agile - adapting to changing situations
	and requirements, and efficient - focusing on properties of immediate
	concern in the context of locally reachable states, thus largely
	avoiding the state space explosion problem. We propose an underlying
	reflective architecture that maintains models of itself, the environment,
	and the mission that is key for adaptation, verification, and validation.

	[11], we contribute a quantitative questionnaire organized along
	five dimensions of agile teamwork analogous to the "Five Factor Model"
	in contemporary psychology. To test this survey tool and its alignment
	with existing studies, we have executed an empirical validation of
	the tool with 79 individuals and 8 international Scrum teams. We
	find that interteam agreement on the factors is high and that the
	survey tool is found very useful. The instrument offers a comparable
	measure to agile teams and gives recommendations for each of the
	factors helping to understand individual as well as organizational
	level barriers. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

	practices are associated with more direct communication and less
	documentation. However, few empirical studies exist that investigate
	the role of documentation in agile development teams. We thus employed
	a questionnaire to measure the perceptions of a group of agile practitioners
	with regard to the documentation in their projects. We obtained responses
	from 79 agile software development professionals and 8 teams in 13
	different countries. Our findings include that over half of developers
	in our data set find documentation important or even very important
	but that too little documentation is available in their projects.
	Agile practitioners do not seem to agree with the agile principle
	that "The most efficient and effective method of conveying information
	to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation." We
	were able to validate this result for a set of dissimilar agile teams
	in various domains. Â© 2011 ACM.},

	perceived in the context of Business Process Management systems.
	This can facilitate the elaboration of consistent process models
	which are better turned to users' needs and organizational changes.
	Despite the variety of tools and notations, process modeling remains
	hardly accessible for business users, who lack advanced technical
	skills. This paper presents an integrated approach for end-user driven
	business process modeling which uses web service based activity tracking
	to generate weakly-structured process models by capturing data on
	personal task management. These models can be adapted and reused
	for ad-hoc process support or exported to formal workflows by delivering
	the business knowledge to process designers and software developers.
	Interconnection of ad-hoc and formal workflows results in enhanced
	process flexibility and allows complementation of formal workflows
	through deviations at runtime. The approach is validated through
	the Collaborative Task Management (CTM) prototype. Â© 2008 Springer

	into a server operating system has brought attention to and concern
	of some severe security issues. Attacks that exploited buffer overflows
	started appearing for the services that were used on the new server
	operating system. Recently, Microsoft decided to implement a protective
	measure: Data Execution Prevention - DEP in two of their products:
	Service Pack 2 for Windows XP and Service Pack 1 for Windows 2003.
	The measure has been implemented as one of the core security mechanisms
	with the intention to prevent the attackers from breaking into the
	system i.e., to prevent the execution of code in non-executable memory
	regions. In this paper we show that the initial implementation of
	the software for DEP in Windows XP Service Pack 2 is actually not
	at all secure and that stack overflow attacks against DEP are as
	effective as attacks against systems that do not have DEP. Â© 2007

	this requires steep learning curve for the new developers. Other
	operating systems for embedded devices have limited support for new
	hardware platforms. Our goal is to provide an operating system for
	resource constrained devices that is easy to use for the wide range
	of researchers and developers familiar with C programming language
	and Unix operating system concepts. In addition, we provide a framework
	for agile portability to new hardware platforms, due to the nature
	of WSN systems that require specific hardware or features for the
	sensing tasks at hand. We propose Multiple agent netted sensor Operating
	System (MansOS), that demonstrates ability to execute the same application
	on different platforms including x86 CPU based computers for easy
	simulation and debugging of a single node or a whole network. The
	new platforms are easily added to MansOS thanks to the well defined
	abstraction layers. MansOS is being successfully used in real world
	applications, such as wild animal tracking and environmental monitoring
	in a fruit care research garden. It has also been used in academic

  abstract = {An innovative molecular docking algorithm and three specialized high
	accuracy scoring functions are introduced in the Lead Finder docking
	software. Lead Finder's algorithm for ligand docking combines the
	classical genetic algorithm with various local optimization procedures
	and resourceful exploitation of the knowledge generated during docking
	process. Lead Finder's scoring functions are based on a molecular
	mechanics functional which explicitly accounts for different types
	of energy contributions scaled with empiric coefficients to produce
	three scoring functions tailored for (a) accurate binding energy
	predictions; (b) correct energy-ranking of docked ligand poses; and
	(c) correct rank-ordering of active and inactive compounds in virtual
	screening experiments. The predicted values of the free energy of
	protein-ligand binding were benchmarked against a set of experimentally
	measured binding energies for 330 diverse protein-ligand complexes
	yielding rmsd of 1.50 kcal/mol. The accuracy of ligand docking was
	assessed on a set of 407 structures, which included almost all published
	test sets of the following programs: FlexX, Glide SP, Glide XP, Gold,
	LigandFit, MolDock, and Surflex. rmsd of 2 Ã…or less was observed
	for 80-96% of the structures in the test sets (80.0% on the Glide
	XP and FlexX test sets, 96.0% on the Surflex and MolDock test sets).
	The ability of Lead Finder to distinguish between active and inactive
	compounds during virtual screening experiments was benchmarked against
	34 therapeutically relevant protein targets. Impressive enrichment
	factors were obtained for almost all of the targets with the average
	area under receiver operator curve being equal to 0.92. Â© 2008

  abstract = {Utilizing chaotic waveform diversity is one method for the generation
	of signals which appear random, in terms of its first-order and second-order
	statistics, thereby appearing indistinguishable from background noise.
	This technology is clearly advantageous for secure communications
	through covert waveform synthesis. In situations where digital chaotic
	encoding is undertaken, the evaluation of the performance of the
	direct synthesis of such signals generally gives rise to comparatively
	high energy-per-bit-to-noise-power- spectral-density (Eb/No) measurements
	for reliable communications. Analysis has indicated that increasing
	the complexity of the signal composition results in degradation in
	error-rate performance; this effect being related to the increase
	in the signal dimension necessary for assuring increased waveform
	covertness simultaneously rendering a detrimental cross-noise effect
	to signal recovery. Methods for alleviating this paradox include
	the utilizing of spread spectrum techniques, both temporal and spectral,
	as well as the augmentation of error control coding (ECC) techniques.
	Furthermore, previous work has developed receiver architectures which
	improve information recovery performance. A ready technology for
	enabling chaotic waveform diversity is through utilizing software
	defined radio (SDR) techniques, a technology that promotes rapid
	and agile waveform diversity. This paper discusses various attributes
	of waveform diversity and design (WDD) with particular attention
	to digital chaotic encoding for secure and covert communications,
	performance assessment and enhancement and the benefits of SDR for
	enabling chaotic waveform diversity. Â©2009 IEEE.},

	practice in a portion of the software industry. It has also been
	argued that pair programming, as a part of the extreme programming
	process, yields higher quality software products in less time. On
	the other hand, these principles are sometimes questioned with respect
	to resource allocation and management issues. Although precise information
	about benefits and costs of the extreme programming practice represents
	a critical guideline for improvement of software quality, there has
	been little work on the subject beyond subjective reports and a study
	in an academic environment. We propose an experimental framework
	to quantify benefits and costs of the pair programming practice and
	compare design aspects of the resulting software products and their
	defect behavior. For this purpose, we use a set of object-oriented
	metrics and software reliability growth models based on service requests.},

  abstract = {Loss less compression is often used before writing data to a storage
	medium or transmitting across a transmission medium. Compression
	aids by saving storage space or transmission bandwidth, a decompression
	operation is performed when the data is subsequently read. Though
	this scheme has clear benefits, the execution time of compression
	and decompression is critical to its application in real-time systems.
	Software compression utilities are often slow, leading to degraded
	system performance. Hardware-based solutions, on the other hand,
	often drive large resource requirements and are not amenable to supporting
	future algorithmic changes. In the current article, we present a
	high-throughput, streaming, loss less compression algorithm and its
	efficient implementation on FPGAs. The proposed solution provides
	a peak throughput of 1GB/sec per engine, with a sustained overall
	measured throughput of 2.66GB/sec on a PCIe-based FPGA board with
	two compression and two decompression engines. This result represents
	an overall speedup of 13.6x over reference software implementation.
	The proposed design is very lean, and, with multiple engines running
	in parallel, provides a path to potential speedups of up to two orders
	of magnitude. In the current implementation, the achievable overall
	throughput is limited only by the available PCIe bus bandwidth. Â©

  abstract = {There exists a growing need in the DOD for a tactical or responsive
	space asset to support real-time battlefield intelligence, surveillance,
	and reconnaissance. The desired attributes include being: 1. Responsive
	- deployable in days; 2. Affordable - expendable tactical resources
	at a cost comparable to other tactical systems; 3. Employable - assets
	must support the Joint Force Commander (JFC); 4. Integrated space/air/terrestrial
	system-of-systems - full network connectivity, bandwidth on demand,
	and augment other assets. To the warfighter, a responsive space asset
	would provide the capability to respond to unanticipated military
	needs in days, providing flexibility of response to rapidly field
	tailored payloads and coverage. This capability could also provide
	rapid reconstitution after a loss from attack or failure and counteract
	enemy adaptation, through denial or deception, to existing space
	capabilities. Most importantly the short deployment times and low
	cost would provide the United States a means for efficiently using
	the versatility, and relative safety of space to provide real-time
	support to the war fighter. To be responsive the space element must
	possess a modular design supporting "plug and play" (PnP) architecture,
	leveraging commercial parts and standards. Lending itself to a lean
	production and integration environment, again utilizing standard
	interfaces and taking advantage of prequalified, inventoried subsystems.
	Rapid deployment of these elements will make use of "canned" mission
	planning tools, tailored orbits for a given theater, built-in health
	& status monitoring, and autonomous test and checkout software and
	operations. The two emerging responsive mission objectives include
	space control and tailored, tactical intelligence, surveillance,
	reconnaissance (ISR Space control involves a situational awareness
	to sense threats against, and provide protection for, US space assets.
	The tailored, tactical missions offer high tempo ISR operations such
	as target characterization and emitter location in theater, perform
	real-time blue force tracking, and provide gap-filler, specialized
	communications support. The challenge is to develop and quality the
	satellite technologies and rapid integration and test processes to
	support an operational responsive system in the next five years.
	Under an Air Force Research Laboratory SBIR program, MicroSat Systems
	is developing a PnP testbed to enable an operational responsive capability
	through development and ground validation of the various elements.
	Those elements include the mission definition and CONOPS specification
	processes, space segment, and the operational prioritization, tasking,
	processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PTPED) process/infrastructure.
	Specific to providing an end-to-end mission simulation, the testbed
	should be equipped with the modeling and simulation tools to develop
	tactical satellite CONOPS and provide the warfighter with a front
	end tool for training. To validate utility to the end-user the testbed
	must be equipped with the capability to simulate the data processing
	and dissemination infrastructure envisioned to provide the battlefield
	commander with real-time data. The space segment of the testbed should
	consist of the hardware and software elements required to simulate
	the operations of a fully functional satellite system. The approach
	to developing a responsive mission testbed includes defining requirements,
	hardware/software architecture, technology development roadmap, starting
	with a core capability, and incrementally integrating and validating
	the developing components and processes as they emerge. © 2005 IEEE.},

	to enable wide adoption of agile methodologies, in particular for
	large-scale projects. In this paper we apply a full lifecycle governance
	model to agile projects, focused on the iteration level. The concept
	is demonstrated via a case study of a large-scale, enterprise-critical
	software project that implemented agile practices. We analyze three
	governance events, including the metrics that triggered the event,
	the decisions taken and the follow-up to ensure resolution. We conclude
	that governance iterations can be naturally unified with agile development
	iterations, resulting in a lean governance mechanism that identifies
	and resolves issues in an effective and timely manner. Â© 2009

  abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed great changes in the way the processes
	related to goods storage, distribution and delivery are managed and
	controlled. New concepts like Just-In-Time (JIT), Lean Manufacturing
	(LM), and Supply Chain Management (SCM) have imposed many requirements
	on warehouse management systems (WMS) related to performance improvements,
	including reduced cycle time, faster order delivery, more accurate
	inventory, customer predelivery information, etc. The Internet boom
	had a big impact on the goods storage and distribution as well. It
	sharply increased the volume of received orders and customers' expectations.
	One could say that all warehouses and autonomous Third Party Logistics
	(3PL) business systems started facing the old challenges with a new
	magnitude: how to control the movement and storage of goods and record
	movement transactions with the greatest possible accuracy and lowest
	possible labor costs while maintaining optimal customer service.
	At the same time the architecture of WMS systems has not been changed
	neither to adopt Just-In-Time (JIT) and Lean Manufacturing (LM) concepts
	nor to efficiently respond to the effects of the Internet boom. Current
	designs of WMS systems, whether they were results of the traditional
	or object oriented analysis, are not an adequate answer for the existing
	challenges. A new design of WMS systems has to offer such solutions
	capable of monitoring events in the warehouse 24 hours daily and
	execute appropriate actions. In other words, a new WMS system design
	has to have a goal oriented processes as opposed to traditional task
	oriented processes. Framework for such development of WMS systems
	is an agent-oriented analysis and design. In this paper application
	of agent-based modeling to the management and optimization of the
	warehouse operations is presented. It is an attempt to develop the
	hardware and software architecture that shall integrate and orchestrate
	all these subsystems and interconnect them, through distributed software
	agents, with a centrally operated database and a middleware system
	implementing all the business intelligence behind the control logic
	and decision-making scenarios serving business objectives.},

	is to bring the power and flexibility of cloud computing to space
	weather physicists. The goal is to lower the barriers for the physicists
	to conduct their science. That is, to make it easier to collaborate
	with other scientists, develop space weather models, run simulations,
	produce visualizations and enable provenance. Success of the project
	is measured by the broad acceptance and use of the platform by the
	space weather science community. To deliver cloud computing and storage,
	infrastructure as a service, the project has built an internationally
	distributed cloud based on Eucalyptus [1]. To provide a graphical
	user interface for the physicists to interact with we selected the
	Groovy programming language and the Grails web framework. To construct
	the software we followed the Scrum agile software development methodology.
	This paper will report on the motivation and risks of such an undertaking.
	It will also report on the suitability of Eucalyptus as a cloud framework
	and the utility of the tools used to build an application on top
	of it. Â© 2011 ACM.},

	requirements of the method. Hence this paper aims at identifying
	aspects of organizational culture that may influence favorably or
	unfavorably the use of XP. In order to identify those aspects, this
	study analyzes dimensions of organizational culture under the perspective
	of practices and values of XP. This paper is based on the review
	of the literature of the area and empirical observations carried
	out with six software companies. This study does not intend to develop
	a tool for measurement of XP's compatibility with the organizational
	culture of each company. It intends to provide parameters (favorable
	and unfavorable aspects) for previous consideration of the convenience

	to measure the system's knowledge distribution in a team of developers.
	It can be used to highlight potential project problems due to the
	inadequate distribution of the system knowledge. Notwithstanding
	its relevance, only few studies investigated the Truck Factor and
	proposed ways to efficiently measure, evaluate and use it. In particular,
	the effective use of the Truck Factor is limited by the lack of reliable
	thresholds. In this preliminary paper, we present a theoretical model
	concerning the Truck Factor and, in particular, we investigate its
	use to define the maximum achievable Truck Factor value in a project.
	The relevance of such a value concerns the definition of a reliable
	threshold for the Truck Factor. Furthermore in the paper, we document
	an experiment in which we apply the proposed model to real software
	projects with the aim of comparing the maximum achievable value of
	the Truck Factor with the unique threshold proposed in literature.
	The preliminary outcome we achieved shows that the existing threshold
	has some limitations and problems. Â© 2011 ACM.},

	traditional, to lean, then agile, did not happen because of a focused
	goal to become lean or agile. Rather, we responded iteratively to
	problems; we were disconnected from our customer, the long delivery
	cycles created issues with testing and verification, and we were
	unable to effectively measure our progress. We changed our delivery
	cycle first to six weeks, then three, with the team focused on the
	highestpriority features and bug fixes. Our one measure of progress
	became working code. We delivered a nightly build to our customer.
	Our QA team tested features as they rolled out. In our journey from
	traditional to agile, we tailored our processes to our team culture
	and our context of work. We found that agile methods increased customer
	and team satisfaction, and enabled us to use limited team resources

  abstract = {We introduce a new kind of diagnostic sensor that combines multifunctional
	measurement capabilities for ionospheric research. Multifunctionality
	is realized through agility in frequency selection over an extended
	band (1.5 to 50 MHz), system modularity, complete system control
	by software written in C, and a user-friendly computer interface.
	This sensor, which we call the frequency-agile radar (FAR), incorporates
	dual radar channels and an arbitrary waveform synthesizer that allows
	creative design of sophisticated waveforms as a means of increasing
	its sensitivity to weak signals while minimizing loss in radar resolution.
	The sensitivity of the FAR is determined by two sets of power amplifier
	modules: four 4-kW solid-state broadband amplifiers, and four 30-kW
	vacuum tube amplifiers. FAR control is by an AT-bus personal computer
	with on-line processing by a programmable array processor. The FAR
	does not simply house the separate functions of most radio sensors
	in use today, it provides convenient and flexible access to those
	functions as elements to be used in any combination. Some of the
	first new results obtained with the FAR during recent field campaigns
	are presented to illustrate its versatility. These include (1) the
	first detection of anomalous high-frequency (HF) reflections from
	a barium ion cloud, (2) the first evidence of unexpectedly large
	drifts and a shear north of the equatorial electrojet, (3) the first
	HF radar signature of a developing equatorial plasma bubble, and
	(4) the first measurements by a portable radar of altitude-extended,
	quasi-periodic backscatter from midlatitude sporadic E. We also mention
	the potential of the FAR for atmospheric remote sensing.},

	Although the iterative, agile approaches have been seen to work well
	in small, flexible organizations, or on smaller projects, they frequently
	fall foul of the larger organization's need for governance, investment
	appraisal and control. Formed in 1967, OCLC develops software for

	Researchers, students, faculty, scholars, professional librarians

	library cooperative. More than 54,000 libraries in 96 countries and

	catalog, lend and preserve library materials. This paper examines
	how TCC, a training and consultancy company from Cheshire, England
	has worked with OCLC, the Online Computer Library Center based in
	Dublin, Ohio to incorporate the Dynamic Systems Development Method
	(DSDM) into a development culture that was deeply-rooted in "traditional"
	software development methods. Examples from multiple projects illustrate
	how the adoption of DSDM helped OCLC change its culture and achieve
	success in software development and deployment. OCLC's TLC dashboard
	was used to track the effectiveness of the development cycle, and

	occurrence of combustion instabilities in gas turbine combustors
	operating in lean premixed mode. Within the EU-funded Marie Curie
	project, LIMOUSINE (Limit cycles of thermo-acoustic oscillations
	in gas turbine combustors), a model test burner has been built in
	order to have reproducible experimental results for model validation.
	The burner consists of a Rijke tube of rectangular section having
	a flame-stabilizing wedge at about 1/4 of its length. Fuel and air
	supplies were carefully designed to give closed end acoustic inlet
	boundary conditions while the atmospheric outlet representing an
	acoustically open end. A transient CFD simulation of the turbulent,
	partially premixed, bluff body stabilized combusting flow has been
	carried out for the LIMOUSINE burner using ANSYS CFX commercial software.
	A 2-D section has been modelled by means of the scale resolving turbulence
	model, Scale-Adaptive Simulation (SAS), and a two-step Eddy Dissipation
	combustion model. Experiments were performed on the LIMOUSINE model
	burner to measure the dynamic variation of pressure and temperature.
	Results were obtained for several cases with power input ranging
	from 40 to 60 kW and air factors between 1.2 and 1.8. The CFD results
	are found to be in good agreement with experiments: the flame is
	predicted to stabilise on the bluff body in the fluid recirculation
	zone; resonance frequencies are found to change depending on power
	and air excess ratio and have a good agreement with experimental
	results and analytical values; pressure oscillations are consistent
	with pipe acoustic modes. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.},

  abstract = {Purpose - Petri net (PN) and queuing theory are used in performance
	analysis of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS). They are used
	to determine the FMS measures of performance. These measures of performance
	include optimal work-in-process (WIP), lead time, production rate,
	machine utilization, and number of servers at each station. The purpose
	of this paper is to present a comparison between PN and queuing network
	tools to determine the optimum values for FMS measures of performance.
	Design/methodology/approach - PN model with dual kanban and closed
	queuing network are used for analysis and performance evaluation
	of FMS. Integrated network analyzer and Lingo softwares are used
	for performance evaluation of FMS by PN tool. CANQ software is used
	for performance evaluation of FMS by queuing network. In both the
	approaches, the throughput is bounded by the utilization of the bottleneck
	machines. Findings - The comparison shows that for the given number
	of servers, PN gives better values of performance measures for FMS.
	The PN optimization gives minimum WIP corresponding to the maximum
	production rate. Minimum WIP leads to minimum lead time. Research
	limitations/implications - The results are concluded based on one
	case study. In future research, the results may be achieved by doing
	more case studies with different numbers of system parameters and/or
	parameter settings. Practical implications - Using the PN model,
	the production manager may design, analyze, evaluate, and even optimize
	the layout of the production system for minimum WIP, maximum throughput,
	and reduced lead time. The determination of the total WIP, total
	number of stations in the production system, and the number of servers
	at each station may be helpful in shop floor management. It may result
	in more production efficiency along with ease of supervision. Originality/value
	- This paper presents a first novel comparison of its kind between
	PN and queuing network for evaluation of FMS. © Emerald Group Publishing

  abstract = {Background: In the past 20years, technological advancements have modified
	the concept of modern operating rooms (ORs) with the introduction
	of computer-integrated surgery (CIS) systems, which promise to enhance
	the outcomes, safety and standardization of surgical procedures.
	With CIS, different types of sensor (mainly position-sensing devices,
	force sensors and intra-operative imaging devices) are widely used.
	Recently, the need for a combined use of different sensors raised
	issues related to synchronization and spatial consistency of data
	from different sources of information. Methods: In this study, we
	propose a centralized, multi-sensor management software architecture
	for a distributed CIS system, which addresses sensor information
	consistency in both space and time. The software was developed as
	a data server module in a client-server architecture, using two open-source
	software libraries: Image-Guided Surgery Toolkit (IGSTK) and OpenCV.
	The ROBOCAST project (FP7 ICT 215190), which aims at integrating
	robotic and navigation devices and technologies in order to improve
	the outcome of the surgical intervention, was used as the benchmark.
	An experimental protocol was designed in order to prove the feasibility
	of a centralized module for data acquisition and to test the application
	latency when dealing with optical and electromagnetic tracking systems
	and ultrasound (US) imaging devices. Results: Our results show that
	a centralized approach is suitable for minimizing synchronization
	errors; latency in the client-server communication was estimated
	to be 2ms (median value) for tracking systems and 40ms (median value)
	for US images. Conclusion: The proposed centralized approach proved
	to be adequate for neurosurgery requirements. Latency introduced
	by the proposed architecture does not affect tracking system performance
	in terms of frame rate and limits US images frame rate at 25 fps,
	which is acceptable for providing visual feedback to the surgeon
	in the OR. Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the adoption level of and experiences from using
	agile practices in three software development projects in a large
	Telecom company. The use of agile practices was more emergent than
	planned. Project managers and developers simply used practices they
	considered efficient and natural. The most widely adopted agile practices
	were to measure progress by working code, to have developers estimate
	task efforts, to use coding standards, having no continuous overtime,
	to have the team develop its own processes, to use limited documentation,
	and to have the team in one physical location. The projects used
	conventional testing approaches. Adoption of agile testing practices,
	i.e., test first and automated unit tests, was low. Some agile practices
	can just emerge without conscious adoption, because developers find
	them useful. However, it seems that an emergent process aiming for
	agility may also neglect important agile practices. Â© Springer-Verlag

	and lean project management practices. The metrics presented here
	are empirical - not subject to bias in reporting or interpretation,
	and focused on measuring the process itself - not the developers
	and artifacts. They are derived from data that commonly exist in
	project software repositories, and thus can be collected with little
	or no cost. The metrics are illustrated with real software development
	repository data collected from a large industry project over a time
	span of several years.},

  abstract = {Most of the well-known management and improvement systems and techniques,
	such as Lean Production (e.g. Just-In-Time (JIT) pull production,
	one piece flow) and Six Sigma (reduction in variation) were developed
	in high volume industries. In order to measure the progress of the
	implementation of such systems, companies and consultants use reference
	frameworks, which contain descriptions of best practice processes.
	The core principles of these systems are applicable in any type of
	industry or service (e.g. focus on reliability and minimisation of
	waste). However, the best practice references and other implementation
	tools are dependent on the context in which the principles are applied.
	For the Engineer-to-Order (ETO) industry, many of the traditional
	practices (e.g. JIT logistics or line balancing) are not applicable.
	In this paper, it is demonstrated that the Capability Maturity Model
	Integrated (CMMI), a best practice reference framework widely used
	in the software industry, contains practices which are also widely
	applicable in ETO companies, but that the original model needs to
	be enhanced. CMMI provides a philosophy, as well as a set of hands-on
	guidelines and measurable stages for process improvement. CMMI may
	provide practical techniques to ETO companies which other companies
	acquire from systems such as Lean Production and Six Sigma. Copyright

  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report a case study in which
	artificial neural network (ANN) has been used for performing fuzzy
	logic based leanness assessment. Design/methodology/approach - Leanness
	is the measure of lean manufacturing practice. Fuzzy logic has been
	used for the calculation of leanness. To improve the effectiveness
	of computation, ANN tool has been used in this study. The network
	has been modeled, trained and simulated using the MATLAB software.
	Findings - The disadvantages associated with the scoring method has
	been overcome by the deployment of fuzzy logic. The problem associated
	with manual computation has been overcome by the application of ANN.
	The simulated model has been validated by measuring the leanness
	level of the case organization. Research limitations/implications
	- The case study has been carried out in a single electronic switches
	manufacturing organization. In the fuzzy logic approach, triangular
	fuzzy numbers are being used in the present study. Practical implications
	- The paper reports a case study conducted in an Indian transformers
	manufacturing organisation. Hence, the results derived from the study
	are validated in a real time manufacturing environment. Originality/value
	- The idea of applying ANN for fuzzy logic based leanness assessment
	is the original contribution of the authors. Â© Emerald Group Publishing

	an enhancement of Business Process Management (BPM) by concepts of
	Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Complex Event Processing
	(CEP). The most important enhancement is the integration of services
	accessible via the Internet that fire events into global event clouds.
	The events can be processed by event processing platforms for aggregating
	the information into higher value complex business events. These
	events can be modeled in a business process execution language within
	a process driven Business Process Management System (BPMS) to trigger
	changes in control flow of a process or start other services. A reference
	model and a reference architecture for ED-BPM are presented, based
	on the NEXOF Reference Architecture. A taxonomy for classifying changes
	to process flow is proposed. Enhancements have to be applied to the
	existing standards in the BPM field, including both the design-time
	and the runtime. A scenario from the banking domain illustrates the
	main concepts and principles. Â© 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {In global software development (GSD) projects, distributed teams collaborate
	to deliver high-quality software. Project managers need to control
	these development projects, which increasingly adopt agile practices.
	However, in a distributed project a major challenge is to keep all
	team members aware of recent changes of requirements and project
	status without providing too little or too much information for each
	role. In this paper we introduce a framework to define notification
	for development team members that allows a) measurement of notification
	effectiveness, efficiency, and cost; b) formalizing key communication
	in an agile environment; and c) providing a method and a tool to
	implement communication support. We illustrate, with an example scenario
	from an industry background, the concept and report results from
	an initial empirical evaluation. From the evaluation it follows that
	the concept allows determining and increasing the effectiveness and
	efficiency of key communication in a global software development
	project in a sufficiently formal way without compromising the use
	of agile practices. Â© 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	much more cost-effective, efficient, agile and better suited to a

	The concept of a tools platform or a unified tool environment is
	most appropriate for embedded instrumentation since different tools
	may be needed at any given point in the life-cycle of a chip, circuit
	board or system. Intel has developed embedded instrumentation methodology

	As Web-based technologies advance rapidly, developing an entirely
	Web-based Kanban system appears to be feasible and promising. This
	paper presents the advantages, limitations, and challenges of Web-based
	Kanban systems. An experimental program has been developed based
	on PHP+MySQL, a popular Web programming platform. The server-executed
	program features cross-platform compatibility, real-time tracking
	and performance monitoring, and greatly enhanced information contents
	compared to physical Kanbans. Human errors are minimized by the automated

	in the operating system Microsoft Windows 98SE / NT/ Me / 2000 /
	XP with information management functions about the monitor and evaluation
	of athletes' physical fitness, function recovery instruction and

	give dynamic analyses about athletes' Physiological Biochemical Index
	and objective assessment about athletes' physical fitness which can
	offer individual therapy to the potential or existing problems. The
	software is mainly applied to the function assessment about athletes'
	Physiological Biochemical Index; meanwhile, the computerized management
	is an aid for coaches in making daily training plans, counting the
	training load and monitoring the swimmers' physical fitness. Â©2009

	of four intelligent components namely accumulative personal preferences
	learning, intelligent resources allocation, reactive controls and
	context-aware proactive controls. It directly interacts with the
	occupants of the IE and interfaces with the underlying physical device
	control software. The tool used to develop the MAS is called JADE
	(Java Agent DEvelopment Framework), a FIPA (Foundation of Intelligent
	Physical Agent)-compliant development framework. It contains a group
	of libraries to assist the development of MASs, a platform independent
	runtime environment and a set of graphical tools for monitoring and
	debugging the designed system. The preliminary MAS core is developed
	and tested in Windows XP environment and is implemented only with
	simple reactive controls. At later stage of the research, the reactive
	controls will be strengthened and other intelligent components will
	be added to complete the system. The ultimate goal of this project
	is to achieve a fully integrated proactive control system via context-aware,
	cooperative multi-agent learning and decision making.},

	in current wireless networks, like inefficient radio spectrum usage
	and limited ability to withstand interferences. The presented spectrum-aware
	radio management framework flexibly negotiates transmission parameters
	based on spectrum usage and application requirements and opportunistically
	utilizes available bandwidth. A key feature of this demonstrator
	is the fact that it breaks the traditional fixed channel bandwidth
	limitation and enables dynamic bandwidth allocation according to
	the needs of applications. It continuously monitors the assigned
	spectrum, tracks application behaviour, and dynamically adapts to
	the radio environment, such as interference and competition. Furthermore,
	a cross-media roaming mechanism is provided in the framework to support
	seamless handovers within and between radio technologies. Our enhancements
	are transparent to upper layer applications and will automatically
	benefit any software using network resources. The presented demonstrator
	uses wireless video streaming in a typical household scenario to
	illustrate the benefits without changes to the multimedia applications.

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with enhancing aspects of project-management
	techniques in relation to maintenance in commercial object-oriented
	software. Maintenance forms a significant proportion of the lifecycle
	of a product and consequently its costs. Techniques such as lean
	production attempt to reduce cost by focusing team effort and to
	pre-empt issues by the use of early detection and resolution strategies.
	This study involves a commercial application written in C++ and its
	evolution over a one-year period. Software product measures are used
	in conjunction with Pareto analysis to determine effective predictive
	class targeting in a release cycle. We assess the capability of the
	measures and consider how the results can be used by the project
	team. The study extends the work of others in this field in three
	ways. First, other studies have analysed procedural code, whereas
	we use an object-oriented code base. Second, most studies assess
	the predictive capability of measures against the number of software
	issues; we examine these factors, but uniquely test for change density
	using density modified measures and we also test for revision volume.
	Finally, we examine the implications of these results and offer a
	cohesive framework of recommendations placed within the lean management
	philosophy. Copyright Â© 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	i.e. the Local Government Act 2000, etc.) a greater degree of accountability
	and public involvement or intervention has become the norm in public
	infrastructure projects, partially under the rubric of "stakeholder
	engagement". This paper seeks to discuss public involvement in a
	law-enforcement technology (Isis), which operates on a covert basis
	in the detection and prevention of child abuse activities across
	a number of social networking facilities. Our contribution to the
	development of Isis is to perform an ethics centered consultation
	process with stakeholders who will contribute to the design and deployment
	of the end software package. To that end, we have sought to develop
	a "Modified Participatory Design" approach, utilizing the knowledge
	gained from the HCI community with regards to more traditional design
	projects and adapting this body of work to questions of ethics, privacy,
	corporate and civic responsibility, monitoring and awareness issues,
	etc. in an effort to create a fluid and agile communication process
	between stakeholders and designers, thus taking account of the ethical
	issues around Isis as design occurs. Â© ACM 2009.},

	stages of the overall product development to both the New Product
	Introduction (NPI) and Production Release processes. For NPI, companies
	must create test systems to support product validation and verification.
	For manufacturing companies, ongoing process metrics are used to
	ensure the product meets quality specifications and can be sold to
	customers. This entire test process is time consuming and resource
	intensive and therefore negatively impacts the overall product net
	revenue, both in terms of time to market and in terms of development
	resources. Large and successful companies invest hundreds of thousands
	of dollars in automated test systems to support product development.
	Such infrastructures provide a competitive advantage by enabling
	a systematic methodology to generate test plans and then automatically
	have the test plan flow through the test software and hardware development,
	test and data collection, and results analysis phases. The Automatic
	Testing Equipment (ATE) industry has pushed to develop a framework
	that supports the sharing of test information, data, and analysis
	results across various enterprise platforms. An IEEE standard know
	as Automatic Test Markup Language (ATML), comprising of an XML schema,
	was proposed and developed in order to allow interoperability of
	test case, data, equipment information, and results. Our methodology
	provides a Service-Oriented Architecture that provides an interoperable
	solution. Users can begin with a test plan, deploy a scalable data
	monitoring and analysis capability, and follow the process from NPI
	through production. Various additional capabilities such as advanced
	analysis capability, customer data sharing resources, test software
	generation and deployment, closed and open source software library
	access, test station monitoring and equipment tracking, automated
	reporting schedules, and others are among the possibilities that
	can be added to the overall process. The proposed architecture is
	entirely scalable and can be deployed in single-site or global applications
	and may be installed behind corporate firewalls or in the cloud.

	environment. To remain in business they must comply with ever-changing
	regulatory requirements while, at the same time, minimizing their
	operational costs without sacrificing customer expectations of service
	levels. Increasingly, airlines are realizing that a "plan-execute"
	mode of operation must give way to a "sense-respond" mode of operation;
	in other words they must become a real-time (agile) organization,
	capable of sensing the occurrence of unforeseen events such as the
	placement of a last-minute shipping order, flight delays, and cancellations,
	and respond effectively in real-time to such events. To enable enterprises
	in general, and the airline industry in particular to improve their
	sense-and-respond capabilities and ensure better resource utilization,
	a number of software vendors are offering event stream processing
	and Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) solutions. This case examines
	a longitudinal set of real-world implementation projects using such
	a solution at a major US airline (referred to as Southern International
	Airlines) and the results and lessons gained from this deployment.

	which the students use a variant of Extreme Programming (XP) including:
	the Planning Game, the Iteration Planning Game, test driven development,
	stand-up meetings and pair programming. We start the course with
	two weeks of controlled lab exercises designed to teach the students
	about test driven development in JUnit/Eclipse and designing for
	testability (with the humble dialog box design pattern) while practicing
	pair programming. The rest of our semester is spent in three four-week
	iterations developing a product for a customer. Our teams are generally
	large (14-16 students) so that the projects can be large enough to
	motivate the use of configuration management and defect tracking
	tools. The requirement of pair programming limits the amount of project
	work the students can do outside of class, so class time is spent
	on the projects and teaching is on-demand individual mentoring with
	lectures/labs inserted as necessary. One significant challenge in
	managing this course is tracking individual responsibilities and
	activities to ensure that all of the students are fully engaged in
	the project. To accomplish this, we have modified the story and task
	cards from XP to provide feedback to the students and track individual
	performance against goals as part of the students' grades. The resulting
	course has been well received by the students. This paper will describe
	this course in more detail and assess its effect on students' software
	engineering background through students' feedback and code metrics.

	computer science classes, this concentration contains three four
	credit software engineering courses. The main goal of this concentration
	is to prepare the students to be able to measure the software development
	process and enact appropriate modifications. This requires that they
	must be aware that there are a variety of software process alternatives
	and when various aspects of each process might be beneficial. In
	addition, they need to be able to apply appropriate statistical analysis
	to assess the process. In order to accomplish this, our Software
	Engineering concentration includes three software engineering specific
	courses: Traditional Lifecycle, Testing & Extreme Programming, and
	Software Metrics/Project Management. In the first two courses, the
	students work in teams to develop products for customers using two
	disciplined, but very different, processes (a variation of TSP[3]
	and XP[6]). By comparing these experiences, the students learn about
	making the choices that software engineers have to make regularly.
	In Software Metrics, we study methods of assessing risks, the process,
	and modifications to the process. This paper will describe these
	courses and the results of our assessment of these courses. © IEEE.},

	in plan-driven methodologies and one in agile methodologies. In these
	courses, the students work on large projects in teams of 14 to 16
	students using variants of Team Software Process (TSP) or Extreme
	Programming (XP). In order to compare the students' experiences with
	these methodologies, the team in the plan-driven course and one of
	the agile teams were given the same problem statement. Throughout
	the semester, we measured team cohesion and individuals' attachment
	to the project. To measure team cohesion, we modified the Group Environment
	Questionnaire that has been shown to accurately reflect team cohesion
	in sports teams. We also developed some of our own cohesion metrics
	and a measure of attachment to the project. While the GEQ showed
	no significant difference between the teams, our measures showed
	higher overall cohesion in XP, but higher sub-team cohesion in TSP.
	At the end of the semester, we also compared the functionality of
	the applications the teams developed and a variety of code metrics
	measuring the quality of their code and its design. While the team's
	developed approximately the same amount of functionality, in general,
	the XP team's code had better metrics. The TSP team required much
	more code to accomplish the same functionality because, although
	they had a strong design, their implementation did not leverage inheritance
	as the design expected. © 2005 IEEE.},

	This highly reconfigurable and frequency agile block is designed
	to be used as an envelope modulator in a wideband multi-standard

	the modulation of the envelope of the RF signal. The DPAs are controlled
	by envelope code words (ECW) at different sample rates. This diversity
	strongly attenuates the images produced by the direct digital to
	RF conversion, avoiding passive filtering. The baseband sample rate
	conversion can easily be reconfigured. The proposed front-end can
	manage spurious emissions depending on the standard, the carrier
	frequency and the required power. The DPAs also integrate active
	input impedance compensation cells in order to limit the input impedance
	modulation when switching the DPA cells. The two-path DPA covers
	a 0.9-1.9 GHz bandwidth with 16.7dBm output 1dB compression point

  abstract = {Near infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy is well established in
	the food industry for rapid compositional analysis of bulk samples.
	NIR hyperspectral imaging provides new opportunities to measure the
	spatial distribution of components such as moisture and fat, and
	to identify and measure specific regions of composite samples. An
	NIR hyperspectral imaging system has been constructed for food research
	applications, incorporating a SWIR camera with a cooled 14 bit HgCdTe
	detector and N25E spectrograph (Specim Ltd, Finland). Samples are
	scanned in a pushbroom mode using a motorised stage. The system has
	a spectral resolution of 256 pixels covering a range of 970-2500
	nm and a spatial resolution of 320 pixels covering a swathe adjustable
	from 8 to 300 mm. Images are acquired at a rate of up to 100 lines
	s -1, enabling samples to be scanned within a few seconds. Data are
	captured using SpectralCube software (Specim) and analysed using
	ENVI and IDL (ITT Visual Information Solutions). Several food applications
	are presented. The strength of individual absorbance bands enables
	the distribution of particular components to be assessed. Examples
	are shown for detection of added gluten in wheat flour and to study
	the effect of processing conditions on fat distribution in chips/French
	fries. More detailed quantitative calibrations have been developed
	to study evolution of the moisture distribution in baguettes during
	storage at different humidities, to assess freshness of fish using
	measurements of whole cod and fillets, and for prediction of beef
	quality by identification and separate measurement of lean and fat
	regions. Â© 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for

	in industrial settings. Evidence of the efficacy of a software development
	practice or process is best obtained through a triangulation of research
	findings obtained through a variety of empirical studies in various
	contexts. The use of an evaluation framework can enable a family
	of related industrial case studies in different contexts to be meta-analyzed
	and/or combined. Such an evaluation framework could consists of templates
	for specific quantitative measures to collect with associated instructions
	on what to include/exclude for consistent measurement collection
	as well as protocols for surveys and/or interviews. Groups of researchers
	interested in the same research question(s) can customize and evolve
	an evaluation framework for the technology under study. We have developed
	and evolved such a framework for the study of Extreme Programming,
	the Extreme Programming Evaluation Framework (XP-EF), which is available
	as a North Carolina State University Technical Report. XP-EF is currently
	at Version 1.4. The composition of Version 1.0 was initially developed
	from relevant literature. We refined the framework in several research
	cycles with industrial partners on four multi-release industrial
	case studies. We have also revised the process based upon input from
	anonymous reviews of our publications from researchers in the community,
	through discussions with members of the International Software Engineering
	Research Network (ISERN), and through presentation of our work to
	researchers and practitioners. Through these cycles of use and external
	feedback, the research and practitioner communities have provided
	input on the guidelines and artifacts embodied in the framework.
	We have conducted four case studies guided by the XP-EF. The reported

  abstract = {A goal of evidence-based software engineering is to provide a means
	by which industry practitioners can make rational decisions about
	technology adoption. When a technology is mature enough for potential
	widespread use, practitioners find empirical evidence most compelling
	when the study has taken place in a live, industrial situation in
	an environment comparable to their own. However, empirical software
	engineering is in need of guidelines and standards to direct industrial
	case studies so that the results of this research are valuable and
	can be combined into an evidentiary base. In this paper, we present
	a high-level view of a measurement framework that has been used with
	multiple agile software development industrial case studies. We propose
	that this technology-dependent framework can be used as a strawman
	for a guideline of data collection, analysis, and reporting of industrial
	case studies. Our goal in offering the framework as a strawman is
	to solicit input from the community on a guideline for the essential
	components of a technology-dependent framework for industrial case
	study research. Copyright 2005 ACM.},

  abbrev_source_title = {Annu. Lean Manage. Solut. Conf. Proc.},
  abstract = {Have you decided to "Lean" your organization but are not sure where
	to start? Eliminating waste from your organization's processes can
	produce tremendous savings that you can pass along to your customers.
	Knowing where to start is not always an easy task. Program management
	provides a good starting point to help establish and work toward
	your strategic objectives, and Lean provides the improvement tools
	to help you achieve that. This presentation will provide an overview
	of program management methodologies and how they apply to successfully
	implement Lean transformation. In order to have a successful Lean
	transformation, the entire scope of the program needs to be evaluated
	from the beginning. Program management starts at the beginning and
	creates an assessment of the entire organization. These methodologies
	help align an organization's overall health and manage the entire
	life cycle of the transformation. They (methodologies) help analyze
	your program's risks, determine costs and returns on investments,
	and develop your action plan and milestones. Developing a proper
	plan can guide you through the improvement process. Outlining the
	reasons for needing improvement should be the first step in addressing
	why you need to incorporate Lean into your processes. Your reasons
	should be commensurate with the strategic goals of the organization.
	This is known as the conception phase, where the idea begins. Do
	you know what your expected benefits are? What are the goals? Is
	it worth the investment? Is it feasible? Do you have adequate resources?
	Next is the definition phase; this is where your planning is critical
	to success. Reviewing your current baseline provides an idea of where
	you are. Using a "current-state map" is an excellent visual cue in
	determining how to prioritize your projects. During this phase a
	team should be identified with a sponsor and proper resources. There
	should be a charter or statement of work that outlines: the problem
	statement; project scope; background information; key measurements
	and targets; risks and benefits; and any assumptions that could affect
	project performance. The project manager or team leader will need
	to outline roles and responsibilities for all team members. Team
	member selection is vital to change because one naysayer can impede
	the progress or reduce enthusiasm. The start phase is where the rubber
	meets the road. Based on discovery in the definition phase, teams
	will measure and analyze data that is gathered. During this phase,
	numerous Lean and Six Sigma tools can be used, such as: value stream
	mapping and analysis; pareto charts; fishbone diagrams; control charts;
	failure mode effects analysis (FMEA); and regression and variance
	analyses. Identification of process capabilities, areas of waste
	and variability, and bottlenecks will become obvious in this phase.
	The performance or improvement phase requires commitment and buy-in
	from every person in the organization. Conducting experiments and
	developing action plans is where the actual improvements are seen,
	whether it is through a pull or kanban system; doing setup reduction
	on a production line; or using preventative maintenance on equipment.
	But the key to success is outlining schedules for completion and
	tracking the implementation. Using a software tool such as Microsoft
	Project is an excellent way to visually track progress and identify
	causes of delays or variances that may impact schedule performance
	and implementation of improvement activities. The last phase, the
	control phase, is never really "over," rather it is a work in progress.
	The program manager captures metrics and measurement of the improvements
	made and compares to the baseline. Sustaining the newly improved
	processes is the toughest part because it involves accepting change
	as the "new way of doing business." Program management tries to expect
	the unexpected and anticipate the issues before they arise or get
	out of hand. It customizes practical experience and expertise and
	applies it to each individual organization. Using these streamlined
	processes reduces costs and cycle time. Program management also increases
	productivity and quality of work. By using program management you
	can assure the success of the Lean transformation throughout the
	enterprise. The process is continual and always in need of review;
	it should become a natural part of "institutionalizing" process change
	in the organization.},

	empirical work, must include assessing its performance effects, and
	whether all or some of its key ingredients account for any performance
	advantage over traditional methods. Given the focus on teamwork,
	is the agile technology what really matters, or do general team factors,
	such as cohesion, primarily account for a team's success? Perhaps
	the more specific software engineering team factors, for example
	the agile development method's collective ownership and code management,
	are decisive. Objective: To assess the contribution of agile methodology,
	agile-specific team methods, and general team factors in the performance
	of software teams. Method: We studied 40 small-scale software development
	teams which used Extreme Programming (XP). We measured (1) the teams'
	adherence to XP methods, (2) their use of XP-specific team practices,
	and (3) standard team attributes, as well as the quality of the project's
	outcomes. We used Williams et al.'s (2004a) [33] Shodan measures
	of XP methods, and regression analysis. Results: All three types
	of variables are associated with the project's performance. Teamworking
	is important but it is the XP-specific team factor (continuous integration,
	coding standards, and collective code ownership) that is significant.
	Only customer planning (release planning/planning game, customer
	access, short releases, and stand-up meeting) is positively related
	to performance. A negative relationship between foundations (automated
	unit tests, customer acceptance tests, test-first design, pair programming,
	and refactoring) is found and is moderated by craftsmanship (sustainable
	pace, simple design, and metaphor/system of names). Of the general
	team factors only cooperation is related to performance. Cooperation
	mediates the relationship between the XP-specific team factor and
	performance. Conclusion: Client and team foci of the XP method are
	its critical active ingredients. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

  abstract = {Conventional privilege separation can effectively reduce the TCB size
	by granting privilege to only the privileged compartments. However,
	since they this approach relies on process isolation to ensure security
	assurance, malware exploiting against kernel components can easily
	compromise. Meanwhile, the frequent inter-process communications
	between separated processes inevitably incur notable overhead. To
	ameliorate these problems, we propose to perform privilege separation
	without partitioning application into two processes. Instead, we
	leverage virtualization to enforce the isolation of sensitive portions
	from other untrusted code. The virtual machine monitor intercepts
	all the code context switches transparently without requiring the
	application to explicitly use IPC as privilege context transition.
	We have implemented a prototype of our system, named Coir, based
	on commodity hyper visor Xen. Evaluation of our prototype includes
	a real-world remote control application, which is partitioned and
	protected in Coir-enabled hyper visor on unmodified Windows XP. We
	discuss the isolation strength as well as the performance penalty
	of our system based on the practical case. Â© 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper presents ShadowReboot, a virtual machine monitor (VMM)-based
	approach that shortens the downtime for software updates during an
	OS reboot. ShadowReboot reboots the guest OS in the background by
	spawning a VM dedicated to an OS reboot and enables the user to switch
	over to the rebooted state where the updated kernel and applications
	are ready for use. ShadowReboot provides an illusion to the users
	that the guest OS travels forward in time to the rebooted state where
	the updated kernel and applications are ready for use. ShadowReboot
	offers the following advantages. It can be applied to any patch to
	the kernels and even system configuration updates. Second, it does
	not need any special patch requiring intimate knowledge about the
	target kernels. Third, it does not require any target kernel modification.
	We implemented a prototype in VirtualBox 3.0.8 OSE. Our preliminary
	experimental results show that ShadowReboot shortened the downtime
	of commodity OS reboots on Windows XP and five Linux distributions
	(Gentoo, Fedora, Cent, Ubuntu, and SUSE) by 43 to 96%. © 2011 ACM.},

  abstract = {Ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) environments often consist of many
	embedded or handheld devices, either mobile or stationary, communicating
	with each other through wireless networks to cooperatively perform
	certain tasks. Recent development in ubicomp provides devices a new
	capability, situation-awareness, which allows devices to sense and
	monitor their ambient environment, analyze the current situations,
	and respond to situation changes by adapting their behavior. Situation-aware
	(SA) ubicomp software will be very useful in various application
	areas, such as homeland security, business, education, health care,
	and environmental control. However, many challenging issues need
	to be addressed for developing SA ubicomp software. The following
	are four major challenges for most SA ubicomp software: Severe resource
	constraints of embedded or handheld devices (communication bandwidth,
	battery power, computing power, etc.). Ad hoc communications among
	devices. The efficiency of detecting situation changes in fast changing
	environments. Volatile software requirements in ubicomp environments.
	Model-driven development methodologies [1] can effectively separate
	application logic from the underlying technologies and support rapid
	development of new interoperability specifications based on proven,
	tested application models. Middleware is an important enabling technique
	for model-driven development. However, in ubicomp, it is difficult
	to create extensive models capturing the volatile software requirements
	before source code is written, and the congruence of models and implementations
	is maintained. Agile development methodologies [2] capture just-in-time
	requirements, but cannot provide support for considering the underlying
	resource constraints and ad-hoc communication with the application
	requirements in a systematic way and validate the implementation
	easily. Model-driven development or agile development alone cannot
	address all the issues for developing SA ubicomp software. Combining
	model-driven and agile development [3] seems to be a promising solution.
	In this address, the current state of the art of model-driven and
	agile software development will be discussed. In particular, two
	important enabling techniques, SA middleware [4] and languages for
	specifying SAW requirements [5], for model-driven agile development
	(MAD) for SA ubicomp application software will be presented. Future
	directions for utilizing MAD methodologies to develop SA ubicomp
	application software with multiple QoS properties will also be discussed.

	detailed understanding of the physical processes involved. The air-fuel
	mixture preparation is a critical step in most advanced gas turbine
	combustion strategies to achieve lower emissions. It has long been
	established that the level of unmixedness between the fuel and air
	is strongly tied with NOx levels. The present paper applies the statistical
	technique of Design Of Experiments (DOE) to a generic mixer set-up
	that includes an axial swirler, with fuel injected at discrete locations
	and transverse to the flow. The objective is to identify influential
	design and operating parameters that will provide rapid and enhanced
	mixing. The parameters tested include Swirl strength as measured
	by the Swirl number, Swirl type (Constant angle vs. Free vortex),
	number and momentum of fuel injection sites and gas temperature.
	Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence of acetone (PLIF) was used to quantify
	mixing at various planar locations in the mixing section. Commercial
	CFD software is used to model the flow field and predict the spatial
	mixing at selected conditions. Comparisons are made with experimental
	measurements with the aim to validate the CFD code and also on comparing
	the model results with the measurements.},

  abstract = {In the scenario of mass customization, production is a crucial phase
	of the whole product life cycle. Production planning and scheduling
	must therefore evolve and adopt new tools that help to obtain a deeper
	control of what has to be produced in order to satisfy efficiently
	customer' needs. This is very important in the clothing and footwear
	(fashion) industry where customer's taste and choices change rapidly
	according to fashion dictates. In this paper an application in the
	footwear sector is presented and tested on a prototype of a new factory
	- an agile production unit - based on the concepts of agile and flexible
	production. The planning and scheduling module proposed is mainly
	focused on the short term in order to respond quickly to market needs
	and changes in a flexible manner. The module is composed of a finite
	capacity scheduler integrated with a new software based on the Analytical
	Hierarchy Process decision support system, which considers all the
	aspects related to order importance as complexity or urgency and
	assign each order a priority. This SW is able to take into account
	many intangible factors, as trademark, that are usually submitted
	to the subjective judge of the production manager (planner) and is
	completely configurable according to user' needs. The result of the
	elaboration, that is the priority value, constitutes a fundamental
	input for the scheduler in addition to the due date of the order.
	The scheduler has a daily horizon because it is unnecessary to cover
	a long-time period if things can change every day following market
	requirements. The scheduler is configured to create all cycle operations
	for each single item even in order to manage orders composed of one
	pair or even one single shoe. This is a fundamental condition under
	a custom-made production focus. This also allows operation fine control
	and monitoring of the manufacturing process because the control system
	can identify exactly where each item at each time is in the system.
	Concluding, further developments are considered within a more integrated
	ad extended scenario applied to the automated production system in
	a new project where the full product life cycle including the customer,
	retailer shop and suppliers are taken into consideration.},

  abstract = {No one questions that SPC is a useful tool that can bring improvements
	to any process. The reason it is not used more extensively or effectively
	is a widely held (but seldom voiced) feeling that it is just "more
	trouble than it is worth." To counter this sentiment, the real savings
	(in dollars) that will accrue after proper implementation must be
	focused upon.4 • It is necessary to properly implement SPC techniques
	to achieve its full benefits. This requires the proper and appropriate
	measurement of the actual, critical process parameters that determine
	quality - not just the ones that are "easy" to measure. Where actual
	physical measurements are impossible, correlated models based on
	real-time indirect measurements can provide a cost-effective solution.
	• Perhaps the most critical factor in reaping the benefits of an
	SPC program is the requirement for real-time analysis of measurement
	data and clear output directly to the operator of the results, including
	trends, warnings and alarms. This is the area that most commonly
	is overlooked or underdeveloped in the industry and it primarily
	is a software issue. Data collection and analysis must proceed automatically,
	permitting operators or supervisors to perform their normal functions.
	Furthermore, the system must be robust and reliable enough for all
	personnel to be confident that when a warning or alarm occurs, something
	really is wrong and requires action. • Dedicated and fully integrated
	software packages can provide the best solution to the problems of
	making SPC work in today's "lean and mean" production environment.
	Because of the multitasking that is expected at all levels, a staff
	has limited time. An independently developed third party package,
	for example, that is dedicated to a specific application can provide
	the out of box, complete functionality required without significant
	setup operations or programming (learning) by in-house personnel.},

  abstract = {Middleware platforms, such as Web services, J2EE, CORBA, and DCOM,
	have become increasingly popular during the last decade. They have
	been very successful in solving distributed computing problems for
	a large family of application domains. The architecture of middleware
	systems have gone through many significant cycles of evolution, both
	in terms of the completeness of functionality and the range of adoptions
	for different types of platforms. However, at the same time, it is
	getting increasingly difficult to achieve and to maintain a high
	level of adaptability and configurability because the structure of
	the middleware architecture is becoming overly complicated and rigid.
	We attribute that problem to the limitations of traditional software
	decomposition methods. Aspect-oriented programming, on the contrary,
	has introduced new design perspectives that permit the superimpositions
	of different abstraction models on top of one another. This is a
	very powerful technique for separating and simplifying design concerns.
	In our effort of applying principles of aspect orientation to the
	middleware architecture, we first pragmatically analyze the use of
	aspects in the middleware architecture. We then show that aspects
	are the correct remedy for the above outlined middleware problems
	by quantifying crosscutting concerns in the legacy implementations
	of several prominent middleware systems. Our aspect analysis results
	strongly indicate that modularity of middleware architecture is greatly
	hindered by the wide existence of tangled logic. To go one step further,
	we factor out a number of crosscutting concerns identified in the
	mining process, reimplement them as aspects, and superimpose them
	back into the refactored architecture. This allows us to use a set
	of software engineering metrics to quantify the refactorization in
	terms of changes in the structural complexity, modularity, and performance
	of the resulting system. This aspect-oriented refactoring proves
	that aspect orientation is capable of composing orthogonal design
	requirements. The final "woven" system is able to correctly provide
	both the fundamental functionality and the "aspectized" functionality
	with negligible overhead and an overall leaner architecture. Furthermore,
	the "aspectized" feature can be configured in and out during compile-time,
	which greatly enhances the configurability of the architecture.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of newer agile integrative business information
	systems (IBIS) environments that use the software agent and the multiagent
	systems paradigms has created the need for a common and well-accepted
	conceptual modeling grammar that can be used to efficiently, precisely,
	and unambiguously, model agile IBIS systems at the conceptual level.
	In this paper, we propose a conceptual modeling grammar termed Agile
	Integration Modeling Language (AIML) based on established ontological
	foundation for the multiagent-based integrative business information
	systems (MIBIS) universe. The AIML grammar provides adequate and
	precise constructs and semantics for modeling agile integration among
	participating work systems in terms of quickly building and dismantling
	dynamic collaboration relationships among them to respond to fast-changing
	market needs. The AIML grammar is defined as a formal model using
	Extended BNF and first order logic, and is elaborated using a running
	example in the paper. The grammar is also evaluated in terms of its
	syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic qualities and is found to exhibit
	a high degree of quality on all these three dimensions. In particular,
	the pragmatic quality of AIML measured in terms of grammar complexity
	evaluated using complexity metrics indicates that AIML is much easier
	to learn and use as compared to the Unified Modeling Language (UML)
	for modeling agile integration of work systems in organizations.

	for the protection of human life and health, the environment, and
	of the vested economic value. The correct functioning of those systems
	has a profound impact also on production cost and product quality.
	The early detection of faults is critical in avoiding performance
	degradation and damage to the machinery or human life. Accurate diagnosis
	then helps to make the right decisions on emergency actions and repairs.
	Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) has developed into a major area
	of research, at the intersection of systems and control engineering,
	artificial intelligence, applied mathematics and statistics, and
	such application fields as chemical, electrical, mechanical and aerospace
	engineering. IFAC has recognized the significance of FDD by launching
	a triennial symposium series dedicated to the subject. The SAFEPROCESS
	Symposium is organized every three years since the first symposium
	held in Baden-Baden in 1991. SAFEPROCESS 2006, the 6th IFAC Symposium
	on Fault Detection, Supervision and Safety of Technical Processes
	was held in Beijing, PR China. The program included three plenary
	papers, two semi-plenary papers, two industrial talks by internationally
	recognized experts and 258 regular papers, which have been selected
	out of a total of 387 regular and invited papers submitted. * Discusses

	of relying on demand forecast and planning, kanban agents reason
	about their own movements to adapt to changing demands. After previous

	performance improvements over the traditional system, we further
	use the Auto-ID Laboratory at Cambridge University to test the feasibility
	of the idea in a realistic manufacturing environment. The results
	from the experiments demonstrated the superiority on several performance
	measures of the intelligent system compared to the traditional system
	used as a benchmark. Moreover, the implementation of the experiments
	exposed several real world constraints not shown in the simulation

  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study kanban-controlled
	pull-systems with machines having the exponential reliability model
	and with buffers finite capacities. Design/methodology/approach -
	Using Markovian analysis closed formulas are derived for the performance
	metrics such as customer service level, average inventory level,
	and throttling of raw part release, for one-machine systems. Then,
	a recursive procedure is developed to extend the performance evaluation
	technique to multi-machine systems. Findings - Once system-theoretic
	properties of the systems under consideration are investigated, the
	paper reveals methods for evaluating the smallest, i.e. lean, number
	of kanbans that ensure the desired level of customer service which
	are developed. Originality/value - Production systems can operate
	in either push or pull regime. The push-systems have been analyzed
	extensively for over 50 years, while the pull-systems have been studied
	to a much lesser extent. Â© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	(IDS) that makes use of advantages of virtual machine (VM) and smart
	disk technologies. The virtual machine monitor (VMM) can prevent
	the IDS itself from potential attacks while the smart disk technology
	provides IDS with a whole view of the file system of the monitored
	VM. We show how to use a tool and some file system knowledge to enable
	the virtual disk to maintain a sector-to-file mapping table (called
	file-aware block level storage) as well as how to detect the changes
	to file content on-line. Based on these features, normal file-level
	intrusion detection (ID) rules can be converted to sector-level ones
	in order to integrate ID functions to the virtual storage. We implement
	such a prototype based on QEMU VMM and the OS of VM is Windows XP.
	Moreover the time overhead introduced by this solution is tested.

	process integration methodology of 4PL is given to solve the problem
	how to effectively identify the business object classes. Third, UML
	is used in the modeling of process integration for 4PL. In the end,
	we give the sequence diagrams of "Partner Selection and Evaluation"
	process reference model in the implementation layer. The proposed
	method laid the theoretical foundation and tangible measures for
	process integration of 4PL which achieve agile synergy from supplier
	with dynamic behaviors, organization autonomy and distribution. Â©

	system resources with large and complicated features, so they need
	high security protection. However, previous security applications
	can not provide adequate protection due to the untrusted execution
	environment. Furthermore, these security strategies cannot support
	a universal cross-platform system security requirements. This paper
	presents VASP, a hypervisor based monitor which allows a trusted
	execution environment to monitor various malicious behaviors in the
	operating system. This is achieved by taking advantage of Ã—86
	hardware virtualization and self-transparency technology, and providing
	a unified security protection to unmodified operating systems such
	as Linux and Windows. Our design is targeted at establishing a security
	monitor which resides completely outside of the target OS environment
	with a negligible overhead. According to the security analysis and
	performance experiment result, our approach can effectively protect
	applications and the kernel at a modest overhead of only 0.9% average
	in Windows XP and 2.6% average in Linux. Â© 2011 ACM.},

	ClearPETâ„¢, has been designed and a first prototype is built
	by working groups of the Crystal Clear Collaboration (CCC). In order
	to achieve high sensitivity and maintain good uniform spatial resolution
	over the field of view in high resolution PET systems, it is necessary
	to extract the depth of interaction (DOI) information and correct
	for spatial degradation. The design of the first ClearPETâ„¢
	Demonstrator based on the use of the multi-anode photomultiplier
	tube (Hamamatsu R7600-M64) and a LSO/LuYAP phoswich matrix. The two
	crystal layers of 8*8 crystals (2*2*10mm3) are stacked on each other
	and mounted without light guide as one to one on the PMT. A unit
	of four PMTs arranged in-line represents one of 20 sectors of the
	ring design. The opening diameter of the crystal ring is 137mm, the
	axial detector length is 110mm. The PMT pulses are digitized by free-running
	ADCs and digital data processing determines the gamma energy, the
	phoswich layer and even the pulse arrival time. Single gamma interactions
	are recorded and coincidences are found by software. The gantry allows
	rotation of the detector modules around the field of view. The measurements
	have been done using the first LSO/LuYAP detector cassettes.},
