\begin{abstract}
This paper provides a sample of a \LaTeX\ document which conforms to
the formatting guidelines for ACM SIG Proceedings.
It complements the document \textit{Author's Guide to Preparing
ACM SIG Proceedings Using \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and Bib\TeX}. This
source file has been written with the intention of being
compiled under \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and BibTeX.

The developers have tried to include every imaginable sort
of ``bells and whistles", such as a subtitle, footnotes on
title, subtitle and authors, as well as in the text, and
every optional component (e.g. Acknowledgments, Additional
Authors, Appendices), not to mention examples of
equations, theorems, tables and figures.

To make best use of this sample document, run it through \LaTeX\
and BibTeX, and compare this source code with the printed
output produced by the dvi file.

\section{Introduction}
The \textit{proceedings} are the records of a conference.
ACM seeks to give these conference by-products a uniform,
high-quality appearance.  To do this, ACM has some rigid
requirements for the format of the proceedings documents: there
is a specified format (balanced  double columns), a specified
set of fonts (Arial or Helvetica and Times Roman) in
certain specified sizes (for instance, 9 point for body copy),
a specified live area (18 $\times$ 23.5 cm [7" $\times$ 9.25"]) centered on
the page, specified size of margins (1.9 cm [0.75"]) top, (2.54 cm [1"]) bottom
and (1.9 cm [.75"]) left and right; specified column width
(8.45 cm [3.33"]) and gutter size (.83 cm [.33"]).

The good news is, with only a handful of manual
settings\footnote{Two of these, the {\texttt{\char'134 numberofauthors}}
and {\texttt{\char'134 alignauthor}} commands, you have
already used; another, {\texttt{\char'134 balancecolumns}}, will
be used in your very last run of \LaTeX\ to ensure
balanced column heights on the last page.}, the \LaTeX\ document
class file handles all of this for you.

The remainder of this document is concerned with showing, in
the context of an ``actual'' document, the \LaTeX\ commands
specifically available for denoting the structure of a
proceedings paper, rather than with giving rigorous descriptions
or explanations of such commands.

\section{The {\secit Body} of The Paper}
Typically, the body of a paper is organized
into a hierarchical structure, with numbered or unnumbered
headings for sections, subsections, sub-subsections, and even
smaller sections.  The command \texttt{{\char'134}section} that
precedes this paragraph is part of such a
hierarchy.\footnote{This is the second footnote.  It
starts a series of three footnotes that add nothing
informational, but just give an idea of how footnotes work
and look. It is a wordy one, just so you see
how a longish one plays out.} \LaTeX\ handles the numbering
and placement of these headings for you, when you use
the appropriate heading commands around the titles
of the headings.  If you want a sub-subsection or
smaller part to be unnumbered in your output, simply append an
asterisk to the command name.  Examples of both
numbered and unnumbered headings will appear throughout the
balance of this sample document.

Because the entire article is contained in
the \textbf{document} environment, you can indicate the
start of a new paragraph with a blank line in your
input file; that is why this sentence forms a separate paragraph.

\subsection{Type Changes and {\subsecit Special} Characters}
We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample.  You
can indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with
the command \texttt{{\char'134}textit}; emboldening with the
command \texttt{{\char'134}textbf}
and typewriter-style (for instance, for computer code) with
\texttt{{\char'134}texttt}.  But remember, you do not
have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are
part of the \textit{structural} elements of your
article; for instance, the heading of this subsection will
be in a sans serif\footnote{A third footnote, here.
Let's make this a rather short one to
see how it looks.} typeface, but that is handled by the
document class file. Take care with the use
of\footnote{A fourth, and last, footnote.}
the curly braces in typeface changes; they mark
the beginning and end of
the text that is to be in the different typeface.

You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or
non-English characters you need anywhere in your document;
you can find a complete list of what is
available in the \textit{\LaTeX\
User's Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

\subsection{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
the three are discussed in the next sections.

\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin. . .{\char'134}end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$. . .\$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsubsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\subsection{Citations}
Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning, clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
conference
proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.
 
The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
No other citation format is endorsed.

\subsection{Tables}
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed
dvi output of this document.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
$\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.


\begin{table*}
\centering
\caption{Some Typical Commands}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Command&A Number&Comments\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}alignauthor} & 100& Author alignment\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Figures}
Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
best placement for them
is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
of figures, use the environment
\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.eps}
and \textbf{.ps} files to be displayable with \LaTeX.  More
details on each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=fly.eps}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format).}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=fly.eps, height=1in, width=1in}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
that has been resized with the \texttt{epsfig} command.}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.

Note that either {\textbf{.ps}} or {\textbf{.eps}} formats are
used; use
the \texttt{{\char'134}epsfig} or \texttt{{\char'134}psfig}
commands as appropriate for the different file types.

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\psfig{file=rosette.ps, height=1in, width=1in,}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.ps format) that has
been resized with the \texttt{psfig} command.}
\end{figure}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\epsfig{file=flies.eps} 
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
that needs to span two columns of text.}
\end{figure*}
and don't forget to end the environment with
{figure*}, not {figure}!
 
There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{displaymath}
l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
\end{displaymath}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the two different
creation commands are in the \textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct, not listed
therein, which you want to have the same formatting as the Theorem or the
Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above, use the
\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert} Because you have just been
given permission to use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a new
form, you might think you can use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a new
command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!} Remember that your \LaTeX\
source code is primarily intended to create camera-ready copy, but may be
converted to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit some or all of
the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will be, to say the least,
problematic.

\section{Aims and research questions}
The aim of this paper is to provide preliminary results from a systematic
review (SR) on agile metrics. Moreover, we are interested on the
industrial use of metrics in agile context.

The performed SR has more research questions but for this paper only
the following are considered:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Why are metrics used?
  \item What actions do the use of metrics trigger?
  \item Which metrics are used?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Search and selection process}

The strategy for finding primary studies was following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initial check that there are enough papers to conduct SR
  \item Pilot
  \item Stage 1: Automated search
  \item Stage 2: Include and exclude based on title and abstract
  \item Stage 3: Include and exclude based on full text. Conduct data
  extraction
\end{enumerate}

Scopus was used to find the primary documents with automated search. The first
search string was:

TITLE-ABS-KEY(software AND (agile OR lean OR "crystal method" OR "crystal
clear" OR dsdm OR "dynamic systems development method" OR fdd OR "feature
driven development" OR "agile unified process" OR "agile modeling" OR scrumban
OR kanban OR scrum OR "extreme programming" OR xp) AND (measur* OR metric OR
diagnostic OR monitor*)) AND (LIMIT-TO(SUBJAREA, "COMP")) AND
(LIMIT-TO(LANGUAGE, "English"))

It found 512 hits 19.9.2013.

Then I noticed that some previously found key papers were missing from the
hits because they were under sub area ``Engineering'', thus the second search
string:

TITLE-ABS-KEY(software AND (agile OR lean OR "crystal method" OR "crystal
clear" OR dsdm OR "dynamic systems development method" OR fdd OR "feature
driven development" OR "agile unified process" OR "agile modeling" OR scrumban
OR kanban OR scrum OR "extreme programming" OR xp) AND (measur* OR metric OR
diagnosticOR monitor*)) AND (LIMIT-TO(LANGUAGE, "English")) AND
(LIMIT-TO(SUBJAREA, "ENGI")) AND (EXCLUDE(SUBJAREA, "COMP") OR
EXCLUDE(SUBJAREA, "PHYS") OR EXCLUDE(SUBJAREA,"MATE") OR EXCLUDE(SUBJAREA,
"BUSI") OR EXCLUDE(SUBJAREA, "MATH") OR EXCLUDE(SUBJAREA, "ENVI") OR
EXCLUDE(SUBJAREA, "EART") OR EXCLUDE(SUBJAREA, "DECI") OREXCLUDE(SUBJAREA,
"ENER"))

It found 220 hits 7.11.2013.

Then I found out that previous searches didn't include many XP conferences
because they were under sub area ``Business'', thus the third search:

TITLE-ABS-KEY(software AND (agile OR lean OR "crystal method" OR "crystal
clear" OR dsdm OR "dynamic systems development method" OR fdd OR "feature
driven development" OR "agile unified process" OR "agile modeling" OR scrumban
OR kanban OR scrum OR "extreme programming" OR xp) AND (measur* OR metric OR
diagnosticOR monitor*)) AND (LIMIT-TO(LANGUAGE, "English")) AND
(LIMIT-TO(SUBJAREA, "BUSI")) AND (EXCLUDE(SUBJAREA, "ENGI") OR
EXCLUDE(SUBJAREA, "COMP"))

It found 42 hits 10.12.2013

\subsection{Initial search process}
(Tähän kai tyyliin et vähän etitty et löytykö mitään laajaa tutkimusta agile
mittareista)

\subsection{Search and selection process}

\subsubsection{Pilot}
A pilot study was conducted in order to refine the aim of the research and get
familiar with the research method. Moreover, it was possible to modify the
method and tools.

The plan was to go through 15 papers from the automatic search:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 5 by top relevance
  \item 5 by top citations
  \item 5 by random
\end{itemize}

The pilot resulted in changing citation manager tool from Zotero to Jabref.
Also, selection stage 2 and 3 were combined. Some codes were generated. The
quality assessment checklist was decided on.

\subsubsection{Stage 1 - Automatic search}

Scopus was used as the only search engine as it contained the most relevant
databases IEEE and ACM. Also, it was able to find Agile and XP conference
papers. Only XP Conference 2013 was search manually because it couldn't be
found through Scopus.

\subsubsection{Stage 2 - Selection by title and abstract}

In stage 2 papers were included and excluded based on their title and
abstract. As the quality of abstracts can be poor in computer
science\cite{kitchenham__2004}, full texts were also skimmed through in case
of unclear abstracts - especially intro, case description and conclusions was
checked briefly. Also, if there were any unclear cases - these were discussed
in weekly meetings and a descriptive exclusion rule was created if necessary.

Selection process was also done for a sample of 26 papers by one other
researcher - the level of agreement was substantial with Kappa
0.67\cite{landis_measurement_1977}.

\subsubsection{Stage 3 - Selection by full text}

Stage 3 included multiple activities in one work flow. Selection by full text
was done, interesting data was coded and quality assessment was done. Once
again, if there were unclear papers, they were discussed in meetings with
other researchers. Sample set of 7 papers was also included/excluded by other
researcher, with an almost perfect agreement, Kappa
1.0\cite{landis_measurement_1977}.

\subsubsection{Inclusion criteria}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Papers that present the use and experiences of metrics in an agile
  industry setting.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exclusion criteria}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Papers that don't contain empirical data from industry cases.
  \item Papers that are not in English.
  \item Papers that don't have agile context. There is evidence of
  clearly non-agile practices or there is no agile method named. For example,
  paper mentions agile but case company has only three releases per year.
  \item Paper is only about one agile practice, which is not related to
  measuring.
  \item Papers that don't seem to have any data about metric usage. Also, if
  there is only a few descriptions of metrics but no other info regarding
  reasons or usage.
  \item Papers that have serious issues with grammar or vocabulary and
  therefore it takes considerable effort understand sentences.
  \item Papers that refer to another paper where the actual case is discussed.
  \item Papers that are in academic or semi-academic setting - customer or
  part of workers are from industry. The reason for this is that it doesn't
  fully represent industry setting as software development methods are likely
  enforced by academia.
  \item Papers where results cannot be separated by setting, for example
  surveys where there is data both from academia and industry. Similarly
  exclusion if results cannot be separated by software development method. 
  \item Papers where the setting is not clear. For example only mention of
  context is ``100 junior developers''.
  \item Papers that are full conference proceedings. Individual papers should
  be already be separated individually.
  \item Papers that where the measurements are only used for the research. For
  example author measures which agile practices correlate with success.
  \item Papers that don't even show measurement usage in a pilot setting. For
  example method or metric is used to a static industrial data set.
  \item Papers that are about the same case, from the same author and same
  research focus, basically the paper format has just changed slightly.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data extraction}

Integrated coding was selected for data extraction
strategy\cite{6092576}. It provides focus to research questions but
flexibility regarding findings. Deductive coding would have been too
restraining and inductive coding might have caused too much bias. Integrated
coding made it possible to create a sample list of code categories, namely:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Why is measurement used?
  \item How is measurement used?
  \item Metrics with metric name
  \item Interesting results 
\end{itemize}

The coding started with reading the full text and marking interesting data
with a temporary code. After, reading the full text I would check each data
pieces and code again with an appropriate code based on the built
understanding. Metric codes were named based on the similarity with the text
it was collected from.

We created a rule set for collecting metrics:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Collect metric only if team or company uses it.
  \item Don't collect metrics that are only used for the comparison and
  selection of development methods.
  \item Don't collect metrics that are used to compare teams.
  \item Collect metric only if something is said about why it is used or what
  actions it causes. 
\end{itemize}

Atlas.ti was used to collect the qualitative data(viiteAtlasiin). 

To evaluate if the same metrics would be found, another researcher coded
metrics from two papers. Capture-recapture method\cite{seber2002estimation} was
then used which showed that 90\% of metrics were found.

\subsection{Quality assessment}
Quality assessment form adopted from \cite{dyba_empirical_2008} was used to
evaluate the quality of each primary document. Additionally, a relevancy
factor was added to the same assessment to describe how useful was the paper
for this study. The scale for the relevancy factor is:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 0 = should be already excluded
  \item 1 = contains only descriptions of metrics with no additional info
  \item 2 = some useful information related to metrics
  \item 3 = A good amount of relevant information regarding metrics and metric
  usage
\end{itemize}


\section{Results - Why and how are metrics used}

This chapter presents the preliminary results from the systematic literature 
review.

High level reasons for using measurements are listed in !nearTable.

\caption{Categories for why and how measurement usage}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Iteration planning}
Many metrics center around iteration planning. Tasks for the next iteration are
selected and prioritized with the help of metrics.

Many metrics were focused to help in the prioritization of tasks for the next
iteration \cite{Greening2010}\cite{Haugen200623}\cite{Hodgkins2007194}. Effort estimation metrics were
used scope out features that would not fit to the iteration\cite{Elssamadisy2002617}.
Consequently, velocity metrics are used to calculate how many features is the
team able to complete in an iteration\cite{Polk2011263}. Velocity metrics can be also used
to improve next iterations estimates\cite{Mahnic201273}. Also, startAndEndDate metric was
used to point out interdependent tasks in planning phase\cite{Hong2010310}. Knowing the
teams' effective available hours is also useful when selecting tasks for a
iteration\cite{Cheng200929}. Measuring the completion of tasks enables selecting incomplete
tasks to the next iteration\cite{Hong2010310}. Prioritization of features can also be
affected by a metric that measures the amount of revenue a customer is willing
to pay for a feature\cite{Hodgkins2007194}. Higher valued customers get their features done
first.
 

\subsection{Iteration tracking} %completion} 
% Timely manner of completing iteration is one of the cornerstones of agile
% development !ISKEVIITE.
Purpose of iteration tracking is to make sure that the tasks selected for the
iteration are completed or that necessary modifications are done to the plan to
end the iteration according to schedule.
Metrics help in monitoring, identifying problems and predicting end result.

Progress metrics made it transparent to stakeholders how the iteration is
progressing.
\cite{Petersen2011975}\cite{Talby2006100}\cite{Mahnic201273}
\cite{Dubinsky200512}\cite{Hong2010310}\cite{Green2011}
\cite{Trapa2006243}\cite{Trimble20134826}. Progress metrics included number of
completed web pages\cite{Hong2010310}, story completion
percentage\cite{Trapa2006243} and velocity metrics\cite{Dubinsky200512}.
However, using velocity metrics can also have negative effects such as cutting
corners in implementing features to maintain velocity with the cost of
quality\cite{Elssamadisy2002617}. Risk management was also mentioned often
\cite{Talby2006100}\cite{Trapa2006243}\cite{Dubinsky200512}\cite{Talby200940}.
If it seemed that not all planned tasks could be completed, tasks were cut from
the iteration \cite{Mahnic201273}\cite{Dubinsky200512}\cite{Middleton2007387} or
extra resources were added \cite{Dubinsky200512}\cite{Middleton2007387}.

 % Almost anyone could walk into a team's room and with a quick glance
 % understand what is the status of the iteration.
When there were problems that needed to be fixed - metrics helped in making
decisions to fix them - whether they were short or long term
\cite{Staron20101069}\cite{Dubinsky200512}\cite{Petersen2011975}\cite{LNBIP01490121}.
It was possible to base decisions on data, not only use common sense and
experience \cite{Talby200940}. Balance of work flow was mentioned as a goal
for using metrics in multiple papers
\cite{Polk2011263}\cite{Petersen2010654}\cite{Greening2010}\cite{Petersen2011975}\cite{Dubinsky200512}\cite{Jakobsen2011168}.
Crosstraining people to work on multiple disciplines was used to balance the
work flow\cite{Middleton2007387}\cite{Talby200940}. Also, metrics were used
focus work on tasks that matter the most, avoid partially done work, task
switching\cite{Seikola2011321} and polishing of features\cite{Talby200940}.
Typically an iteration ends in a release but if too many defects are found the
release must be delayed as happened in one case \cite{Hodgetts2004106}.


%\subsubsection{Project progress}
%While iteration completion is important - so is the whole project's completion.
%Metrics were also used to monitor the whole project: assess risks, follow work
%completion and 

\subsection{Motivate and enable team to improve}
(Agile methods emphasize self-empowerment - this was also
 visible in the used metrics.) This section describes metrics that are used to
 motivate people and make them improve on their own.

Metrics were used to communicate different data about the project or product to
the team members
\cite{Trapa2006243}\cite{Talby200940}\cite{Polk2011263}\cite{Staron20101069}\cite{Talby2006100}.
Measurement data motivated teams to act and improve their
performance\cite{Talby200940}\cite{Polk2011263}\cite{Cheng200929}\cite{LNBIP01490121}\cite{Jakobsen2011168}.
Some examples include fixing the build
faster\cite{Jakobsen2011168}\cite{LNBIP01490121}, fix bugs
faster\cite{Cheng200929} or creating unit tests to declare the completion
of a feature\cite{Talby200940}.

Metrics can be also used to prevent harmful behaviour such as cherry picking
tasks that are most interesting. Measuring work in progress and setting WIP
limits prevent cherry picking by enforcing only few work items at a
time.\cite{Middleton2007387}

\subsection{Problem identification}
Metrics are often used to identify or avoid problems in
processes and work flows. This chapter describes how metrics
can be used to spot problems.

There were multiple cases highlighting how measures are used to identify or
predict problems so that the problems
could be solved or
avoided\cite{Petersen2011975}\cite{Trapa2006243}\cite{Mahnic201273}\cite{Petersen2010654}\cite{Shen200725}\cite{Mujtaba2010139}[Tudor].

Sometimes there can be work phases where no value is added for example ``waiting
for finalization''. This type of activity is called waste and can be identified by using
lead time.\cite{Petersen2012108}

Creating awareness with defect trend indicator helped to take actions to avoid
problems\cite{Staron20101069}.
Some metrics are used continuously while some are only checked in certain intervals(ei
oo muistissa viitettä tähän). In some cases there are defined limits in metrics that
trigger improvement actions(en muista viitettä tähän). One observed solution to problems
was to find the root cause\cite{Jakobsen2011168}\cite{Middleton2007387}.

\subsection{Pre-release quality}
Metrics in the pre-release quality
category were used to prevent defects reaching customers
and to understand what is the current quality of the
product.

Integration fails were a common problem to avoid with
metrics\cite{Cataldo2011161}\cite{Janus20129}. Moreover, metrics were used to
make sure that the product is sufficiently tested before the next step
in the release path\cite{Janus20129}\cite{Dubinsky200512}. Additionally,
making sure that the product is ready for further
development was mentioned. Also, using metrics to improve
pre-release quality was goal in one case\cite{Janus20129}. Some
metrics force the approach of writing tests before actual
code\cite{Trapa2006243}.

\subsection{Post-release quality}
Metrics in post-release quality deal
with evaluating the quality after it has been released.
Customer satisfaction, customer responsiveness and quality
indicators are seen as attributes of
post-release quality. Some metrics
include customer input to determine post-release quality\cite{Petersen2010654}\cite{Green2011}\cite{Cheng200929}[]
while other metrics use pre-release data as predictors of external
quality\cite{Staron20101069}\cite{Petersen2010654}\cite{Green2011}.
Customer related metrics include for example defects sent by customers\cite{Cheng200929}, change
requests from customers\cite{Petersen2010654} and customer's willingness to recommend product to
other potential customers\cite{Green2011}.
Quality prediction metrics include defect counts\cite{Petersen2010654}, maintenance
effort\cite{Staron20101069} and deferred defect counts\cite{Green2011}.

\subsection{Changes in processes or tools}
This chapter lists what kind of changes metrics
had for processes and tools.

The successful usage of sprint
readiness metric and story flow metric changed company policy to have target values for
both metrics as well as monthly reporting of both metrics by
all projects\cite{Jakobsen2011168}.

At Ericsson by monitoring the flow
of requirements metric they decided to change their
implementation flow from push to pull to help them deliver
in a more continuous manner. Also, based on the metric they added
intermediate release version to have release quality earlier
in the development cycle.\cite{Petersen2010654}

Changes to requirements managements were also done based on metrics in
an other case at Ericsson\cite{Mujtaba2010139}. 

The problem with broken build, and the long times to fix the build gave birth
to measurements that monitor and visualize the state of the build and the time
to fix it\cite{LNBIP01490121}\cite{Jakobsen2011168}\cite{Janus20129}(ei
välttis oikea kappale).
Also, additional code style rules were added to code check-in and build tools
so that builds would fail more often and defects would get caught before the
release\cite{Jakobsen2011168}\cite{Janus20129}. Similarly, testing approaches
were changed based on flow metrics\cite{Mujtaba2010139}\cite{Staron20101069}.
